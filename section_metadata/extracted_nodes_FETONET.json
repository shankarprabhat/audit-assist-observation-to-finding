The tracer injection will be followed by a \nsaline flush.   Patients will receive a maximum 18F activity of 165 MBq. \nStatistical Methods and Planned Analysis: \nUsing results of dynamic scanning and metabolite analysis an appropriate protocol will be designed to analyse \nthe diagnostic static scans.  The internal radiation dosimetry as well as biodistribution of t he tracer will be \ncalculated. Comparison between FET-βAG-TOCA PET and standard of care somatostatin receptor imaging \nwill be made based on \nboth a per-patient and per-lesion based analysis. Non-parametric McNemar test with Bonferroni correction for \nmultiple comparison will be used.   The association between SSTR1-5 expression and imaging parameters \nobtained will be assessed. Data will be analysed using SPSS 16.0 for Windows. \n \nBio-distribution and Radiation Dosimetry  \nBio-distribution  data  in  patients  will  consist  of  18F  activity  content  in  organs  and  tissues  of  interest,  18F  activity \nconcentrations in whole blood and plasma and of 18F activity excreted in the urine.  Descriptive statistics will \nbe generated for bio-distribution data at each time point for each organ and tissue of interest. The amount of \n18F activity excreted in urine in patients will be calculated from the product of concentration of 18F activity \nmeasured in each sample and the volume of each sample for a subset of patients. \n \nSafety \n \nSafety parameters will be summarized using \ndescriptive statistics"

    "content": "Neuroendocrine  tumours  (NETs)  are  tumours  derived  from  enterochromaffin \ncells, which are characterised by the presence of neurosecretory granules \ncomposed of a variety of hormones and biogenic amines. These t umours can \nrelease vasoactive substances into the systemic circulation, resulting in episodic \nflushing, wheezing, diarrhoea, and eventual right-sided valvular heart disease. All \nof these symptoms negatively i mpact on patients’ quality of life. NETs can \noriginate at any sit e, however the common site of disease is the midgut \ncomprising of 40% to 70% of all NETs1. Whilst initially thought to be relatively \nrare, it is evident from the US Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results \ndatabase that the incidence and prevalence has increased s ubstantially \n(approximately 500%) over the past 30 years, and unlike most other solid \ntumours, the incidence continues to rise 2. Within the UK 3000 patients are \ndiagnosed each year making it the 11th most common cancer in the UK, and the \nsecond most prevalent tumour of the gastrointestinal tract. \n \nThe management of NETs is primarily determined by the stage of the disease. \nFor patients with localised or limited disease the primary modality of therapy is \nsurgery, whilst in patients with metastatic disease, systemic therapy is employed \nwith palliative intent.  Accurate imaging is therefore central to the management of \nthis disease. \n \nWhilst computer tomography is useful in the initial localisation of NETs, nuclear \nimaging using t umour-specific radiolabelled receptor analogues or amine \nprecursors are considerably more sensitive and specific methods for detecting \nNETs and their metastases. Five SSTR subtypes (1-5) have been identified in \nhuman tiss ues, with 70 – 90% of NETS expressing subtypes 2 and 5. \nSomatostatin analogues, such as octreotide, bind with high affinity to SSTR2 and \nSSTR5, and with varying affinity to SSTR3 and 4. When chelators such as \ndiethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) or 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododedcane- \nN, N’, N’’, N’’’ – tetraacetic acid (DOTA) are coupled to these analogues, they \ncan be labelled with [111In] or [99mTc] for scintigraphy in  order to stage NETs. \nFurthermore, positive uptake on these scans will predict the likelihood of patients \nresponding to therapy utilising radiolabelled somatostatin analogues.  Currently, \n[111In]-DTPA-octreotide SRS is the clinical gold standard for the imaging of these \ntumours, however there is an emerging clinical trend for the use of PET based on \nimproved sensitivity and specificity. \n \nIn a review of pooled data from over 1200 patients, [111In]-DTPA-octreotide SRS \nshowed a median detection rate of 89% (range 67% to 100%) and a median \nsensitivity of 84% (range 57% - 93%)3. Whilst SRS is accurate, false positive \nresults can be seen from the presence of inflammatory conditions that can be \nassociated with an increase in S STR expression such as in Crohn’s disease 4. \nFurthermore, NETs t hat are either too small or do not express high levels of \nSSTRs will not be detected. Other reasons for scan failure include low signal in \nareas of high background activity such as the liver and low spatial resolution."

    "content": "13 \nFETONET study      version 3.5      12th December 2016 \n \nAcquisition time is also prolonged, up to 48hours, making it inconvenient for both \npatients and nuclear medicine departments. Therefore, there is clearly a need to \ndevelop more accurate imaging techniques. The utility of PET imaging for \nvisualising NETs has been highlighted with the development of [68Ga] -labelled \nsomatostatin analogues. PET has superior physical characteristics compared to \nSRS including spatial resolution, sensitivity and quantification, and [68Ga]-labelled \nligands also show higher affinity for SSTR 2 and 5 and more rapid clearance from  \nthe  blood  compared  with  [111-In]-labelled  tracers,  with  images  being obtained \n60-90min following tracer injection. Furthermore, the radiation dose is lower using \nthese tracers. \n \nPreclinical and clinical studies have described the use of a number of analogues \nincluding DOTA-Tyr3 octreotide (DOTA-TOC), DOTA-Tyr3,Thr8octreotide (DOTA- \nTATE) and DOTA-1-NaI3-octreotide (DOTA-NOC) in the imaging of NETs 5-8. \n[18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET has been extensively st udied in NETs \nhowever the sensitivity of this imaging technique is low, 25 to 73%, because of \nthe relatively low metabolic activity of NETs, making [18F]-FDG-PET not suitable \nfor the routine clinical imaging, with its role currently limited to the visualisation of \npoorly differentiated tumours. Imaging with [68Ga]-DOTA-TOC PET has been \nreported to be more sensitive than [18F]-FDG PET in patients with primary or \nrecurrent  NETs  9.  Furthermore,  clinical  studies  comparing  [68Ga]-DOTA-TOC \nPET with [111In]-octreotide scintigraphy s uggest that [68Ga]-DOTA-TOC PET is \nmore sensitive than SRS in detecting NETs as a result of greater signal-to- \nbackground contrast 10,  11. Currently it is unclear which [68Ga] tracer - DOTA- \nTOC, DOTA-TATE or DOTA-NOC - is the best and there is no consensus for \ntheir use partly due to lack of a robust supply mechanism for the radiotracers for \nclinical trials. It is clear, however, that the sensitivities of these tracers are better \nthan SRS due to use of PET. \n \nThe main limitations with [68Ga]-DOTA-analogues PET are the requirement for an \non-site Gallium generator for tracer manufacture resulting from the much shorter \nhalf life of [68Ga] compared to [18F] tracers that can be shipped easily to several \nsites and the low throughput of such generators, the poorer resolution of [68Ga] \ncompared to [18F] and the paucity of clinical grade GMP radiotracer for large \nmulti-centre trials. We, therefore, sought to develop a fluorine-18 labelled \noctreotate analogue which can be effectively used to image NETs by employing \na versatile two-step GMP-compatible click chemistry method; embodied in the \ndesign of these fluorinated analogues, strategies to improve tumour uptake and \nsystemic PK 12. F luorinated somatostatin analogues have been previously \ndeveloped due to their superior physical properties f or PET imaging, however, \ntheir clinical utility have been limited by high background uptake making it very \ndifficult to visualise tumours particularly t hose within the liver, the main site of \nmetastatic disease.   We have developed a  novel [18F] labelled somatostatin \nanalogue with improved in vivo kinetics compared to previously published [18F] \nlabelled analogues."

Tumour uptake was maximal with FET-G-TOCA, followed by FET- \nβAG-TOCA and [18F]-AlF-NOTA, with the least tumour uptake seen with [68Ga]- \nDOTATATE.  Incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers to reduce non- \nspecific protein interactions and increase circulation time, as exemplified by \n[18F]- FET-G-PEG-TOCA and FETE-PEG-TOCA, resulted in reduced uptake in \nhigh SSTR2 expressing AR42J pancreatic cancer xenografts, and these were not \ntaken forward.  Whilst tumour uptake was maximal with [18F]-FET-G-TOCA, \nits slow hepatic clearance meant that this was not taken forward, and [18F]-FET- \nβAG-TOCA, which showed the lowest non-specific uptake in liver, was selected \nfor further d evelopment (13).The specificity of [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA tumour \nuptake was illustrated through a number of experiments.  Firstly, a radiolabelled \nscrambled peptide derived from [ 18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA, [18F]-FET-βAG-[W-c-\n(CTFTYC)K], did not show t umour uptake. Secondly, there was a 2-fold lower \nuptake of [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA in AR4 2J xenografts when mice were pre-\ntreated with 10 mg/kg of unlabelled octreotide. Finally t here was low uptake of \n[18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA in low SSTR-2 expressing HCT116 xenografts.  \n \nThe safety profile of [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA as a single microdose study in rats \nwas assessed by a commercial GLP laboratory in accordance with MHRA/EMEA \nguidelines (see attached). There was no tracer (or precursor) related toxicity at \n1000x the intended human dose. Rat radiation dosimetry studies, conducted by \nGE Healthcare are complete. The radiotracer showed a suitable organ dose \nprofile. The new fluoroethyltriazole-[Tyr]3-octreotate radioligand, F ET-βAG- \nTOCA, combines high specific binding with rapid target localization for high \ncontrast PET imaging."

Patients from cohort 1 (n=8-12), 4-6 \nfemale and 4-6 male (each cohort minimum 3) will be used in the final analysis. \nPatients with locally advanced or metastatic NETs of any site will be recruited \nfrom the Endocrinology, Surgical and Oncology Outpatients clinic, Hammersmith \nand Royal Free Hospitals.  After obtaining informed consent, eligible patients will \nhave blood taken at baseline for FBC, EUC, LFTs (routine clinical practice), and \nserum biomarkers.   Patients will undergo routine staging.   In addition, patients \nwill undergo [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA P ET/CT scanning at Imanova. Patients’ \noriginal diagnostic tumour biopsy (paraffin fixed) will be obtained. \n \n8.1.1 Cohort 1. Dosimetry and safety study in patients with histological \ndiagnosis of NETs of any site. \nIn this initial evaluation patients presenting for routine staging will be consented \nto undergo whole body dynamic scanning (multiple whole body scans up to 3.5 \nhours) with metabolite analysis in order to develop a suitable protocol for static \nscanning that will be used for patients in cohort 2. We will also calculate the \ninternal   radiation   dosimetry, which   may   alter   the   administered   dose   in \nsubsequent studies. Alt hough we do not expect any toxicity, we will conduct \ndetailed safety assessment in this group of patients. We require a minimum of 8 \npatients for final Dosimetry and safety analysis, which should include a minimum \nof either 3 male or 3 female subjects. To ensure both sexes are sufficiently \nrepresented in the final Dosimetry, for calculating effective dose, Co hort 1 will \ntherefore include a minimum of 8, but up to 12 subjects. \n \n8.1.2 Cohort 2. Open label study assessing tumoural uptake of [18F] -FET- \nβAG-TOCA –PET in patients with histological diagnosis of NETs of any site . \nPatients presenting for routine staging will be consented to also undergo a static \nPET/CT imaging with [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA in order to compare the clinical utility \nof [18F]-FET-βAG-TOCA – PET/CT with standard of care somatostatin receptor \nimaging . As a translational endpoint, patients will also be consented for retrieval \nof their pre-treatment biopsy specimen. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be \nperformed for expression of SSTR1-5, which will be correlated with PET images \nfrom both tracers (see section 4.2 for Summary)"

In a dosimetry study such as this, \nthe estimate is necessarily uncertain but a conservative approach has been \ntaken that will overestimate the effective dose by using a high dose conversion \nfactor of 0.04 mSv/MBq injected activity. The total effective dose of 14 mSv \n(cohort2)  is equivalent to about 6 times the average yearly exposure (2.3 mSv) \nfrom natural background radiation in the United Kingdom. For an adult in good \nhealth, this exposure would result in a risk of around 1 in 1600 (cohort1) and 1 in \n1400  (cohort2)  of  contracting  a  fatal  cancer,  However,  for  someone  in  the \nplanned study groups who have shorter life expectancy t han the general \npopulation         it         represents         a         significantly         lower         risk. \nNote that as part of the standard practice for patients included in this study, a \nsingle [68Ga] Dotatate PET/CT scan will be performed; this is one of the entry \nqualifications but is not an additional examination that is part of the research \nprotocol."

The records will be stored in a location allowing easy \nand  timely  retrieval  when  needed  (for  example,  for  an  audit  or  inspection). \nWhere permitted by local regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these \nrecords may be maintained in a format other than hard copy (for example, in an \nelectronic format), but caution should be exercised.  The Investigator will ensure \nthat all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate copy of the original. \nAll study records must be retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a \nmarketing application in an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or \ncontemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or (2) at least 2 years \nhave elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. \nThe PI/institution should retain subject identifiers for at least 15 years after the \ncompletion or discontinuation of the study.  Subject files and other source data \nmust be kept for the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution \nor private practice, but not less than 15 years. These documents should be \nretained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory \nrequirements. The PI must be notified and will assist with retention should \ninstitution be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full 15 years. \nIt is the responsibility of PI to inform the institution as to when these documents \nno longer need to be retained. \n \nIf an I nvestigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, retires, requests to \nmove records to another location or to assign these records to another party or \n(e.g. other Investigator) who will accept the res ponsibility, written notice of this \ntransfer must be made to and agreed upon by each party. \n \n \n \n17.7 Study Monitoring \n \nThe Investigator is res ponsible for ensuring that t he study is  monitored \nappropriately in  order to ensure compliance with GCP and local regulatory \nguidelines. The monitor will check the completeness of medical records, verify \nthe accuracy of entries in the CRF, and ensure adherence to the protocol and \ncompliance with local regulatory requirements. \n \n \n17.8 Final Report \n \nA final in tegrated report will be prepared under t he responsibility of the \nInvestigator(s). It will include the tabulated raw data and the biostatistical report \non the data."
