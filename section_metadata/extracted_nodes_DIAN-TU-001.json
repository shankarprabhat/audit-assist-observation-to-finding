The currently existing Dominantly Inherited \nAlzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) sites will continue to be active for \nnew study drug enrollment and new sites will continue to be identified and \nqualified. \nStudy Objective \nTo assess the safety, tolerability, biomarker, cognitive and clinical efficacy of \ninvestigational products in participants with an Alzheimer’s disease-causing \nmutation by determining if treatment with the study drug slows the rate of \nprogression of cognitive/clinical impairment or improves disease-related \nbiomarkers.   \nStudy Population \nParticipants who are either known to have a mutation causing Alzheimer’s \ndisease OR who do not know their gene status but are “at-risk” for a \ndominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease (DIAD) mutation AND who are \neither 1) cognitively normal and are between 10 years younger (−10) to 10 \nyears older (+10) than their expected age at symptom onset or 2) have mild \nsymptoms of dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0.5 or 1).  Individual \ndrug arms may require genetic disclosure to participate based on their \nspecific design.   \nFor the cognitive run-in (CRI) period only, the study population will be \nexpanded to include participants who have a DIAD mutation in the family \nAND are cognitively normal and who are 11 to 25 years younger (−25 to −11) \nthan their estimated age of symptom onset in order to include participants \nfor future trials that may have differences in the enrollment age of onset. \nStudy Design \nThis is an adaptive platform-based study, which allows flexibility to add a new \ncompound to the same protocol, allowing participants to be randomized to \nstudy drug arms open to enrollment, and to maintain a cohort of trial ready \nparticipants with or at risk for DIAD mutations.  The study has three periods: a \nCRI period, a double-blind treatment period, and an open-label extension \nperiod, which may differ by drug arm.  Data may be pooled from the placebo \ngroups of different drug arms, from the CRI period, and from the DIAN \nObservational (DIAN-OBS) study to serve as pooled controls for treatment \nefficacy evaluation per the inclusion and exclusion of each drug arm."

For further information relevant to these \narms, see earlier versions of the protocol.   \nParticipants enrolled to double-blind drug arms are treated with active drug \nor placebo, while biomarker (e.g., positron emission tomography (PET) \nimaging, volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal \nfluid (CSF), and plasma measures), clinical, cognitive, and safety assessments \nare monitored throughout the study period.   \nStarting with Amendment 8 of this protocol, a CRI period was opened for \nrecruitment if no relevant study drug arms are randomizing to drug or \nplacebo.   \nThe biomarker, cognitive and clinical endpoints may be used to conduct \ninterim analyses in any of the study drug arms; a study drug arm may be \nstopped early or revised (e.g., dose adjustment or treatment duration) based \nupon the results of the interim analyses or information from other clinical \ntrials for the same drug, as outlined in each drug-specific appendix. \nThe study has a common close design included in specified drug arms, in \nwhich double-blind treatment is continued for all participants until the last \nparticipant enrolled completes the 4-year randomized period of treatment or \nwithdraws.    \nMutation positive participants will be randomized to active drug or placebo at \na ratio specified in each drug-specific appendix.  Groups enrolled \nsimultaneously will be balanced by a minimization algorithm including clinical \nstate and stage of disease measures (CDR-SB, years from onset) and other \nfactors (gene type [APP, PSEN1, PSEN2] years of education, age, presence of \nan APOE ε4 allele, region, study site and gender).  When not excluded in an \nindividual drug arm, participants who are mutation negative will be assigned \nplacebo. \nAt the request of participants, mutation negative participants may be \nincluded to maintain blinding as to genetic status for those who do not wish \nto know their genetic status.  Mutation negative participants may be included \nin individual drug arms when feasible and appropriate.  Participants who are \nmutation negative will be assigned placebo.  Data from mutation negative \nparticipants will be used to develop models for longitudinal changes in \nbiomarkers and cognition in healthy adult controls. \nNumber of \nParticipants \nThis study will recruit participants from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer \nNetwork observational study (DIAN-OBS), a multicenter international study \nsupported by the National Institutes of Health (Grant Number \nU01-AG032438; RJ Bateman), Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trial \nUnits (DIAN-TU) sites, DIAN-TU partner sites, DIAN Expanded Registry (DIAN-\nEXR), and families identified by the sites."

Exclusions include MRI contraindications, required \nanticoagulation therapy, and pregnancy.  Participants who know they are \nmutation non-carriers are not eligible. \nRoute and Dosage \nForm \nRoute and dosage forms are included in each drug-specific appendix.  There is \nno study drug administered during the CRI period. \nDosage Dosage is included in each drug-specific appendix. \nDuration of \nTreatment \nThe total treatment duration for any blinded study drug arm is determined by \nthe enrollment duration, and is not expected to exceed the sum of the \nenrollment duration and the planned double-blinded period (e.g. if the \nenrollment duration is 2 years and treatment is 4 years, the total treatment \nduration will not exceed 6 years).   \nIf the CRI period is open to enrollment, participants may be enrolled in the CRI \nperiod.  Participants will continue in the CRI period until a study drug arm is \nopened for randomization, but no longer than approximately 3 years.  If a \nparticipant is in a CRI period, a minimum of 8 weeks must elapse between the \nparticipant’s last administration of the cognitive battery during the CRI period"

As part of the DIAN-TU-001 protocol, participants undergo \nlongitudinal assessments that include clinical assessment, cognitive testing, magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) and amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and analysis of \nblood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). \nParticipants in DIAN are recruited from families that have at least one member who has been \nidentified as having a mutation linked to dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease (DIAD).  The \nmutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) that \nare associated with dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease have very high penetrance (near \n100%).  This study enrolls individuals who are either known to have a disease-causing mutation \nor who are at risk for such a mutation (the descendant or sibling of a proband with a known \nmutation) and unaware of their genetic status.  Because the age at onset of cognitive changes is \nrelatively consistent within each family and with each mutation (Ryman, Acosta-Baena et al. \n2014), an age at onset is determined for each affected parent or mutation as part of the DIAN \nObservational study (DIAN-OBS) protocol.  This study will enroll participants who are either \nasymptomatic and are within a specific window of time of expected age at onset for their family \nand/or mutation or who have symptoms of mild Alzheimer’s disease. \nThe ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and predict the \nage of onset with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess the \nefficacy of therapies at asymptomatic and very early stages of dementia.  Families with known \ndisease-causing mutations are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the \nworld.  These constraints necessitate a specialized study design.  Many of the participants in this \nstudy will not yet have any cognitive symptoms of AD; they will be “asymptomatic” carriers of \nmutations that cause DIAD and would be expected to perform normally on standard cognitive \nand functional testing.  Imaging and fluid biomarkers will be used to demonstrate that the \ntreatment compounds have engaged their therapeutic targets.  A set of cognitive measures \ndesigned to assess the very earliest and most subtle cognitive changes will be collected.  \nAdditionally, because many at-risk individuals decide not to know whether they have the \ndisease-associated mutation or not, when allowable in individual drug arms, some of the at-risk \nindividuals enrolled in this study will not have the disease-causing mutations; they will be \n“mutation negative”.  It is important to enroll these participants to avoid coercion (e.g., \npotential participants may be pressured into genetic testing to learn their genetic status in order \nto be eligible for the trial) unless the drug-specific design includes open-label treatment.  These \nmutation negative individuals will be assigned to the placebo group and data will be used to"

Thus, \nthe study will be double-blinded for placebo and for mutation status, except for mutation \npositive participants who are aware of their genetic status.  There may be exceptional \ncircumstances when required by local regulation or health authorities where enrollment may be \nrestricted to mutation carriers only, but such mandates will be thoroughly documented and \nagreed upon by the governing regulatory agency and sponsor. \nThis is an adaptive platform-based study (Woodcock, LaVange 2017).

The compounds are selected for this trial based on \nmechanism of action and available data on efficacy and safety profile.  The study design includes \na pooled placebo group (referred to as the mutation positive placebos) which may be shared by \nstudy drug arms.  Mutation positive participants will be assigned to a study drug arm and \nsubsequently randomized within that arm to the active drug to placebo ratio specified in each \ndrug-specific appendix.  When included in individual drug arms, mutation negative participants \nwill all receive placebo treatment.  Participants and study staff will not be blinded as to which \nstudy drug arm each participant has been assigned; they will be blinded as to whether \nparticipants have been randomized to active drug or placebo.   \nBiomarker, cognitive, and/or clinical endpoints will be specified for each study drug arm.  \nBiomarker data will be analyzed for pre-specified endpoints consistent with the drug’s \nmechanism of action and other AD biomarker outcomes.  \nInterim analyses of the imaging or fluid biomarker endpoint will assess safety and whether each \nstudy drug engages its biological targets.  The clinical and cognitive assessments are designed to \nassess subtle cognitive changes that may be detectable before the onset of dementia as well as \ncognitive and clinical decline in symptomatic groups.   \nAfter the last participant in a study drug arm completes the 4-year treatment period, \nparticipants in that study drug arm may be eligible to receive active study drug in an open-label \nextension period (Section 3.9). \nStarting with Amendment 8 of this protocol, a cognitive run-in (CRI) period was implemented to \nallow for enrollment during periods when study drug arms are not randomizing.  This enables \nthe DIAN-TU platform to have continuous enrollment during periods before or in-between drug \narm randomization. \nThe CRI period of cognitive, clinical, and imaging data collection was designed as part of the \nplatform study to utilize the time in between enrollment of study drug arms for the purposes \noutlined in Section 1.4 of this protocol.  The CRI period was incorporated into the protocol as \nspecified in the US NIH NexGen grant, which was reviewed and awarded in August 2017 (US NIH \nGrant R01 AG053267, PI RJ Bateman).  Based on the early discontinuation of the atabecestat \ndrug arm in July 2018, the cognitive run-in period was implemented to recruit until the next \nstudy drug arm is randomizing to drug and placebo.  The CRI period will enhance study"

The pathological processes that \ndefine AD, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, start to develop 10 to 20 years before \nclinical symptoms (Price and Morris 1999; Price, McKeel et al. 2009).  Findings from the DIAN \nobservational study (Bateman, Xiong et al. 2012) indicate pathological and biomarker changes \noccur at least 15 years before the estimated symptom onset in the DIAN cohort.  Fluid and \nimaging biomarkers of amyloid include positron emission tomography (PET) using the amyloid-\nbinding agent [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) ([11C]PiB-PET) (Mintun, Larossa et al. 2006) and \ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (Aβ42) (Fagan et al, 2006) and the \nratio of Aβ42/Aβ40 (Lewczuk et al, 2016).  CSF total tau (Fagan, Head et al. 2009) and \nphosphorylated tau181 (ptau181), have shown early asymptomatic changes in DIAD (Bateman et \nal., 2012,  et al, 2020) and when combined with Aβ42 can predict cognitive decline (Fagan, et al. \n2007; Schindler et al., 2017). \nStudies in individuals who carry a mutation linked to early onset AD suggest that these \nbiomarker changes are detectable 20 or more years before the anticipated time of disease onset \n(Figure 1) (Bateman, Xiong et al. 2012; Portelius, Fortea et al. 2012; Ringman, Coppola et al."

Neurofilament light \nchain has previously demonstrated changes in response to therapies in multiple sclerosis and \nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (Varhaug et al. 2019). Although NfL is non-specific for AD, \nit may allow for a measurement of disease modification in response to the active therapies.  \nFurther, NfL has demonstrated pre-symptomatic changes in DIAD 7 to 16 years before symptom \nonset (Preische et al. 2019). \nCortical volume loss (as measured by volumetric MRI [vMRI]) and cerebral metabolism \n(measured by PET visualization of 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose [FDG-PET]) assess anatomic \nand metabolic sequelae of neurodegeneration.  Substantial literature supports the idea that \nthese biomarkers correlate with pathological disease and may be predictive of clinical outcome.  \nLevels of the CSF biomarkers and [11C]PiB binding correlate with risk of developing dementia in \nasymptomatic individuals and with the risk of developing more severe impairment in those with \nvery mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment (Hansson, Zetterberg et al. 2006; Fagan, Roe et \nal. 2007; Li, Sokal et al. 2007; Morris, Roe et al. 2009; Snider, Fagan et al. 2009).  In \nasymptomatic older individuals, increased levels of brain amyloid as detected by increased \n[11C]PiB-PET signal or reduced CSF Aβ42 are not benign as they are associated with increased \nrates of brain atrophy (Wang, Fagan et al. 2011; Chetelat, Villemagne et al. 2012).  \nNondemented individuals with amyloid deposition as detected by amyloid PET have poorer \nperformance on episodic memory testing and are more likely to experience cognitive decline \n(Doraiswamy, Sperling et al. 2012; Sperling, Johnson et al. 2012).   \nIn contrast to Aβ accumulation, autopsy studies suggest that the density and distribution of \nphosphorylated tau and of neurofibrillary tangles increases during the course of dementia due \nto AD, with higher levels observed in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and at more \nsevere levels of dementia (Braak and Braak 1995).  Tau accumulation may correlate with \nneurodegeneration across the entire spectrum of the illness (Duyckaerts, Brion et al. 1987; \nNelson, Alafuzoff et al.  2012).  Aβ accumulation may serve as a biomarker for the earliest \nstages of disease, while longitudinal and quantitative assessments of the level and extent of tau \ndeposits may better reflect the progression of neurodegeneration over time.  Studies of CSF \nAβ42 and tau levels in participants in the DIAN Observational (DIAN-OBS) study support this idea \n(Bateman, Xiong et al. 2012; Benzinger, Blazey et al. 2013; Fagan, Xiong et al. 2014).  This \nunderstanding of sequential changes in tau biomarkers identifying tau stages in DIAD, and a \nfour-fold higher change in tau PET signal in DIAD compared to sporadic AD among symptomatic \nparticipants, has greatly improved the potential to detect drug effects in DIAD (Barthélemy et \nal., 2020, Gordon et al., 2019). \nTau pathology in the brain correlates more closely with clinical status and dementia in AD than \namyloid plaques, atrophy, or glucose metabolism (Ossenkoppele et al., 2016).  Tau aggregation \ncorrelates with onset, progression, and neurologic type and has large significant increases in \nDIAD relative to healthy normal individuals.

The inclusion of tau PET imaging will be limited to participants between −10 to +10 years \nof their estimated years to symptom onset (secondary prevention population) and will provide \nimportant data for the longitudinal evolution of tau pathology during the AD disease process, \nand the relationship of Aβ and tau in disease pathophysiology.  Tau imaging during the CRI \nperiod will help assess the rate of change in tau pathology in untreated participants, enable \nappropriate designs of tau-based therapeutics, and provide longitudinal run-in control data to \nbe compared during the randomization period of the study.  Tau imaging at the end of the CRI \nperiod and during the course of the subsequent treatment period will help assess long-term \neffects of potentially disease modifying drugs and the rate of change in tau pathology in both \ntreated and untreated (placebo group) participants. \nCSF levels of tau and ptau will be used as additional endpoints.  These biomarkers may reflect \nneuronal or axonal injury, as evidenced by the correlation of CSF levels of total tau with the \namount of tissue damage and poor clinical outcome in acute brain disorders (Hesse, Rosengren et \nal. 2000; Ost, Nylen et al. 2006).  Levels of ptau measured in CSF samples obtained during life \nhave been shown to correlate with the amount of neocortical tangle pathology at autopsy \n(Buerger, Ewers et al. 2006;  Barthélemy 2020; Mattsson et all, 2020) suggesting it may serve as a \nmarker of tangle pathology.  Some studies have shown that elevated tau and ptau alone predict \nprogression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to DAT (Blom, Giedraitis et al. 2009), while \nother studies demonstrate that the ratio of tau(s) to Aβ42 are highly predictive of cognitive \ndecline in cognitively normal cohorts (Fagan, Roe et al. 2007; Li, Sokal et al. 2007; Craig-Schapiro, \nPerrin et al. 2010) as well as individuals with MCI or very mild dementia (Hansson, Zetterberg et \nal. 2006; Snider, Fagan et al. 2009; Craig-Schapiro, Perrin et al. 2010; Landau, Harvey et al. 2010; \nTarawneh, D'Angelo et al. 2011; Buchhave, Minthon et al. 2012).  Levels of CSF tau and ptau are \nalso elevated in DIAD mutation carriers during both the presymptomatic and symptomatic stages \n(Moonis, Swearer et al. 2005; Ringman, Younkin et al. 2008; Bateman, Xiong et al. 2012; Ringman, \nCoppola et al. 2012). \nAntibodies targeting amyloid plaques have impacted the removal of plaques and showed some \nchange in other biomarkers.  For example, an OLE of gantenerumab in sporadic AD, with \ntreatment over 36 months after starting up-titration substantially lowered PiB-PET to below the \nlevel of amyloid positivity (Klein et al. 2021).  A number of other compounds have also shown \neffects on these biomarkers (Knopman DS, 2021; Mintun MA, 2021; Salloway S, 2021; Swanson \nCJ, 2021). \nThese studies support the idea that successful target engagement by the tested compounds \nwould result in a detectable effect on imaging and fluid biomarkers, allowing the use of the"

The specific biomarker endpoint chosen for each \ntested study drug will depend on the mechanism of action of the target compound and on \navailable preliminary data on the effects of the therapy on relevant biomarkers (see each drug-\nspecific appendix and respective Investigator’s Brochures for additional details).   \n Rationale for Cognitive Run-in Assessments \nA CRI period may be opened to enrollment prior to randomization into study drug arms added to \nthe platform trial.  Run-in periods have several practical advantages, including increasing \nengagement of participants, establishing rapport with site personnel and personnel for home \nvisits (if applicable), and familiarization of participants with the processes and procedures of the \ntrial (Schechtman et al., 1993; Pablos-Méndez, et al., 1998).  One of the most important \nscientific advantages is a decrease in variability in cognitive test performance.  Most participants \nare unfamiliar with the cognitive testing process and some may be anxious during cognitive \ntesting.  Scores from measures acquired during their first exposure to the testing process can \ntherefore be influenced by random and systematic within-person variability.  For example, daily \nvariability in sleep quality, fatigue from traveling to a DIAN-TU performance site, or a recent \nexposure to a stressful event can introduce random variability to assessments.  There may also \nbe other factors introduced into cognitive testing that may contribute to variability.  Practice \neffects refer to increases in cognitive scores that appear upon retesting as participants become \nfamiliar with the test content, the testing environment, and test concepts and strategies.  \nTypically, these practice effects peak after two to three exposures to test stimuli and diminish \nwith further retesting (Hassenstab et al., 2015; Ivnik et al. 2000).  There may be additional \nvariability in test performance due to demand characteristics (the perceived expectation by \nparticipants to perform in a certain way to “please” the examiner) or to factors that influence so-\ncalled “white-coat” hypertension, where performance may be affected by anxiety about \nundergoing testing and “exposing” latent cognitive deficits that many participants from DIAD \nfamilies are highly concerned about.  The combined effect of high variability on cognitive \nperformance may impact reliability in cognitive outcomes.  A CRI period can reduce the effects \nof temporal fluctuations in performance by allowing participants to habituate to the testing \nprocess, thereby reducing practice effects, demand characteristics and test anxiety.  Moreover, \nresults from clinical trials testing the β-secretase enzyme (BACE) inhibitors in those with and at \nrisk for AD have identified evidence of an unanticipated cognitive impairment (Novak, et al., \n2020).  A CRI period will also offer the opportunity to more easily detect a deleterious drug \neffect by establishing a reliable baseline in participants where the majority are cognitively \nnormal at trial entry.  This is particularly important for those participants that are much younger \nthan their estimated age of onset where a decline in cognition would represent a significant \ndeviation from the expected performance.  The CRI period could help identify potential \ndeleterious side effects of therapies at an earlier point and reacting appropriately."

Participants and study staff will be blinded as to \nwhether participants are on active drug or placebo but will not be blinded as to the treatment \nroute and interval.   \nThis is an adaptive platform-based study, with flexibility to add new investigational products to \nthe protocol, allowing participants to be randomized to study drug arms open to enrollment, \nand for the study to maintain a cohort of trial ready participants with or at risk for DIAD \nmutations.  Data from the platform’s placebo drug arms will continue to be utilized by \nsubsequent drug arms as control data, in addition to the DIAN-OBS matched control data."

The double-blind periods concluded for both drug arms with an \nopen-label extension (OLE) of gantenerumab opened to any of the participants enrolled in either \nof the double-blind drug arms.  Changes, such as to the enrollment criteria (e.g., the EYO range \nfor inclusion), may be made based on the specific therapeutic compounds being tested and the \nstage of disease that is most likely to be targeted by a therapy.  Results from the completed \nsolanezumab and gantenerumab arms in DIAN-TU-001, which included an EYO range of −15 to \n+10, found that close to 30% of participants at an EYO range of −15 to −10 had very low amyloid \nPET levels, and thus had minimal to no detectable tau pathology.  Therefore, the change to the \nEYO entry criteria for CRI and future tau-based therapeutics to −10 to +10 in Amendment 11 will \nincrease the likelihood of participants having some tau-related changes that can be measured \nduring the double-blind period of the trial.  The third drug arm added to the platform was the \natabecestat arm which was prematurely discontinued due to safety (Novak, G, et al. 2020).  For \nfurther information relevant to the completed testing periods of these study drug arms, see \nearlier version(s) of the protocol.  \nAdditional study drug arms will continue to follow the same core procedures for measuring \nbiomarker, cognitive, and clinical measurements, thereby allowing continued sharing/pooling of \nplacebo data across study drug arms.   \nStarting with Amendment 8, a CRI period was opened for recruitment and enabled for future \ndrug arms.

Amendment 11 \nrefines the primary and secondary prevention populations to −25 to −11, and −10 to +10, \nrespectively.  CRI participants must have a minimum of 8 weeks between the participant’s last \nadministration of a complete cognitive battery during the CRI period and administration of the \nbaseline (V2) complete cognitive battery.  The CRI period will continue until a study drug arm is \nopened for randomization, but no longer than approximately 3 years. Amendment 13 extends \nthe duration of CRI up to 3 years. Participants having completed 2 years in CRI before \nAmendment 13 approval may be reconsented once approved for Amendment 13; participants \nshould resume their study visits based on their original CRI Entry date. \nThe platform is designed to test drugs’ engagement of its respective targeted biomarker (phase \nII period) and those successful in engaging their biomarker target will continue to a clinical \nand/or cognitive outcome (phase III period).  The biomarker endpoints and cognitive endpoints \nmay be used to conduct interim analyses in any of the study drug arms.  The design includes the \npotential to conduct at least one interim analysis of the biomarker and/or cognitive endpoints.  \nThe number and timing of interim analyses may vary for each study drug arm.  Details about the \ninterim analyses are described in each drug-specific appendix.  If a study drug fails to \ndemonstrate target engagement, as evidenced by meeting a pre-specified threshold at one of \nthe interim analyses, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) may recommend that a study \ndrug arm either be stopped early or that the study dose be escalated, if dose escalation is \ndeemed safe.  If a study drug achieved significant slowing of cognitive decline at the cognitive \ninterim analysis, the study drug arm may be terminated early for efficacy. \nStudy drug arms that demonstrate a potential clinical benefit may have an open-label extension \nperiod.  \n Rationale for Study Design \nTwo unusual features of this study population influenced the study design: 1) maintaining the \nblind to mutation status, and 2) participant burden.  First, many individuals who are at risk for \ndominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease do not want to know their mutation status.  The study \ndesign has allowed for enrollment of these individuals as it permits participants and study staff \nto remain blinded to mutation status.  Mutation negative participants will not be exposed to \nactive study drug.  However, for each additional drug arm, requirements for participants to \nknow their mutation status may change based on the design (i.e. a drug arm may require a drug \ntreatment for all participants as part of the protocol, such as in a combination therapy \napproach).  Mutation positive participants will be randomized between study drug arms and \nplacebo.  The placebo group of mutation positive individuals will be pooled among the \ntreatment groups (“mutation positive placebos”), increasing the statistical power of the study.  \nThis use of a pooled placebo group enables a study of more than one therapy to be powered"

Because participants typically work and have family \nresponsibilities, there is increased burden of travel and time spent on study activities; however,  \na high level of participant retention is essential for the success of the study. Therefore, \nparticipants who reside outside a reasonable distance from their “host” trial site will be asked to \ntravel to the site only when needed for highly specialized assessments (e.g., PET scans, lumbar \npuncture (LP), and specialized cognitive testing; these occur at least annually).  Regular visits \n(e.g., for administration of study drugs) may be performed by trial-designated and Good Clinical \nPractice (GCP) trained home health nurses or other trial-identified satellite sites.  For relevant \nstudy drug arms, the 3T safety MRIs that are not part of an Annual Visit may be performed at \neither the participant’s host DIAN-TU site or a trial-identified location qualified for the study \nnear the participant’s home.  For all study drug arms, the annual MRI session will be performed \nat a DIAN-TU site. \nFurther, this platform study design allows for flexibility and for the application of an “adaptive \ndesign” for which study drug is used.  For example, if a study drug failed early due to adverse \nevents or lack of efficacy, a new compound could be added to the same protocol and new \nparticipants could be randomized to the actively enrolling study drug arms or a CRI period may \nopen for recruitment.  \nA more traditional study design with separate biomarker and cognitive endpoints would be \nextremely difficult in this cohort for two reasons:  1) The participant pool is very limited as \nfamilies with DIAD causing mutations are rare; and 2) A prolonged treatment period (≥ 4 years \nin this study) may be needed to determine if the study drugs can slow or prevent cognitive \nchanges in an asymptomatic cohort.  The inclusion of these cognitively normal participants is \nvery important, as they may be most likely to benefit from disease-modifying treatments. \nHowever, the subtle cognitive change in the asymptomatic mutation carriers limits the power \nto detect treatment effects when there are small numbers of participants enrolled.  One \nmethod to improve the power to detect treatment effects is to include additional control \nparticipants.  The DIAN Observational study (DIAN-OBS) has been following nearly the same \nprotocol as DIAN-TU-001 to study the natural history of disease progression in DIAD.  Given the \nsimilarities of the protocol and the fact that the DIAN-OBS study has contributed a significant \nproportion of the participants to the DIAN-TU-001, data will continue to be used from DIAN-\nOBS participants who meet the inclusion criteria for DIAN-TU-001 to track disease progression, \nregardless of the specific therapy being tested.  The DIAN-OBS data will be used as additional \ncontrol participants and will be utilized as a control group to improve power. \nCognitive Run-in Period to Establish Trial-Ready Cohort \nA CRI period may be opened prior to randomization into drug arms added to the platform trial.  \nTo determine the potential benefits for statistical power, a detailed simulation analyses was"

Across all datasets, including slopes and \nintercepts from pre-randomization periods as covariates resulted in the largest increases in \nstatistical power for a 4-year simulated trial.  Statistical power increased by 5-11% depending \nupon randomization scenarios (3:1, 1:1) and the length of the pre-randomization period.  In \naddition, the use of pre-randomization cognitive testing will align the DIAN-TU with ongoing \ninitiatives — the Trial Ready Cohort (TRC) for preclinical/prodromal AD (PAD) trials (TRC-PAD; \nNCT03638583) and the European Prevention of Alzheimer Dementia Longitudinal Cohort Study \n(EPAD LCS; NCT02804789) — that are developing trial-ready populations for AD prevention \ntrials (Aisen et al., 2016). \nThe CRI period will also allow participants that do not currently qualify for DIAN-TU-001 studies \n(e.g., more than 10 years younger [> −10] than estimated years at symptom onset) to \ncontribute to the understanding of patterns of cognition at the earliest stages of the disease \nproviding scientific contributions.  With the development of primary prevention studies in \nDIAN-TU (US NIH Grant U01AG059798, PI EM McDade), defined as studies in a population at \nrisk for DIAD but known to be mostly free of any detectable pathology at trial entry, there is a \nstrong interest in establishing a trial ready cohort to accelerate recruitment into the \ntherapeutic trial once launched.  Furthermore, it also allows at-risk persons that have not yet \nparticipated in the DIAN network to experience one component of the clinical trial process.  \nThis can help to identify those participants unlikely to be able to stay in a long prevention trial if \nthey are able to start CRI but not continue.  These latter two considerations help with trial \nefficiency. \nFor further rationale, see Section 1.4. \n Number of Participants and Sites \nIndividuals will be recruited by host DIAN-TU sites and may also come from other sources such \nas referring partner sites, and the DIAN-EXR.  DIAN-TU sites are located globally.  The number of \nsites and locations may be expanded over the course of the study. \nRecruitment of mutation positive participants is with baseline CDR 0 to 1 (inclusive).  Mutation \npositive groups (active vs. placebo) will be enrolled to meet the respective enrollment numbers \nof asymptomatic (CDR 0) and symptomatic (CDR > 0) participants. \nFor the gantenerumab and solanezumab arms, a total of 193 participants were enrolled into the \ndouble-blind period (144 mutation carriers and 49 mutation non-carriers) with 52 mutation \ncarriers on active gantenerumab, 52 mutation carriers on active solanezumab, and 40 mutation \ncarriers in the pooled placebo arm. \nThe CRI period may recruit up to 740 participants during any time where a drug arm is not \nactively randomizing to meet the enrollment required for the three tau-targeted drug arms \nslated for secondary prevention enrollment (Tau NexGen) and the drug arm(s) slated for primary \nprevention.

Refer to the final \nSAP for drug-specific differentiation of endpoint classification based on the respective drug’s \ntarget and mechanism of action. \n Safety Endpoints \nThis study will assess safety and tolerability in individuals at risk for dominantly inherited AD.  \nSafety endpoints used will be the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events \n(TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and treatment discontinuations.  Analysis will be on an \nintent-to-treat basis.  Clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and 12-lead ECGs will also be \nmeasured throughout the study. \nAmyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) measures are a safety endpoint in studies of \namyloid removing drugs.  Based on the assigned study drug arm, periodic MRI scans may assess \nfor ARIA changes.  ARIA can occur as either cerebral edema (ARIA-E) or as hemorrhages (ARIA-\nH), typically microhemorrhages, but larger hemorrhages and frank infarction have also been \nreported (Sperling, Salloway et al. 2012).  MRI scans will be analyzed for ARIA changes at the \nMayo Clinic Aging and Dementia Imaging Research (Mayo-ADIR).  The number of \nmicrohemorrhages (ARIA-H, including both hemorrhages and hemosiderin deposits) and size of \nareas of edema (ARIA-E) will be monitored at entry and throughout the trial.  Incidence of ARIA \nand comparison to placebo will be made."

This review will \ninclude contact with the participant or caregiver to assess for any symptoms associated with \nthe changes and discussion with the central readers.  The PAL, as a site independent clinician, \nwill help ensure consistency of decisions within a study drug arm across sites during the study.  \nSee each drug-specific appendix for drug-specific ARIA algorithms.  The DIAN-TU Medical \nDirector will ensure consistency across study drug arms and will have final decision-making \nauthority on changes in dosing of study drug or safety monitoring; this decision should be \nreceived by the site within 7 days of the report of the new ARIA changes, but no later than the \nday prior to the planned administration of the next dose of medication.  A similar process will \nbe followed if a follow-up MRI shows worsening of a previously reported ARIA. \nAdditional assessments based on drug-specific safety concerns are detailed in each drug-\nspecific appendix (Appendix 3 for gantenerumab and Appendix 4 for E2814). \nAn independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will assess safety data periodically \nthroughout the study.  The DSMB will have timely access to data, including clinical laboratory \nvalues, ECGs, MRI results, and clinical and cognitive testing scores; this will include access to \nunblinded data when requested.  The DSMB will monitor the incidence of ARIA and comparison \nto placebo.  See Section 7.10 and the DSMB charter for additional information. \n Study Schedule \nThe schedule of visits, including drug-specific tests and frequency for each drug, is provided in \neach appendix.   \n Total Study Duration and Duration of Treatment \nThe total study duration depends on the time in CRI, the duration of each drug arm, and any \nextensions or OLE for the associated drug arm.  For drug arms utilizing a common-close design, \nthe treatment duration of each study drug arm may vary depending on the duration of \nenrollment and the treatment time needed for the study drug to achieve its goal.  A study drug \narm may be stopped early or revised (e.g., dose adjustment or treatment duration), based upon \nthe results of the interim analyses or information from other clinical trials for the same drug, as \noutlined in each drug-specific appendix. \nParticipants in double-blind periods will continue to receive blinded treatment until the last \nparticipant enrolled completes the randomized period of treatment or withdraws (“common \nclose”).  Based on the time required for full recruitment, the total duration may vary from 48 to \n80 months.  For example, participants enrolled in the first month may receive treatment for \napproximately 72 months (if recruitment takes 24 months + 48 months of treatment); for those \nenrolled in the last month, the duration of treatment would be 48 months."

If a participant is participating in a \nCRI period, a minimum of 8 weeks must elapse between the participant’s last administration of \nthe cognitive battery during the CRI period and administration of the baseline (V2) cognitive \nbattery of a treatment arm. \nOnce a decision is made for an OLE of a study drug arm, participants may be eligible to continue \nor start treatment in an open-label extension period (Section 3.9) if the study drug arm \ndemonstrates potential clinical or cognitive benefit. \nDetails regarding study duration and duration of treatment are described in the CRI and drug-\nspecific appendices in Appendix 1, Appendix 3, and Appendix 4. \n Open-label Extension \nUpon completion of the double-blind treatment period for each study drug arm (i.e., last \nenrolled participant has completed), an open-label extension (OLE) period may be initiated for \ndrugs that demonstrate a potential for clinical benefit, with approval from the sponsor.  In the \nOLE period, participants may be eligible to receive active study drug for an additional treatment \nperiod as specified in the drug-specific appendices. \nOnly DIAD mutation positive participants will be eligible for an OLE period; mutation negative \nparticipants (non-carriers) will be excluded.

Participants \nare encouraged to proceed with genetic counseling, at a minimum, in preparation for disclosure \nof DIAD mutations, before the end of the double-blind treatment phase to enable more rapid \nentry into the OLE.  Consent forms for OLE periods will be available towards the timeframe \nwhen an OLE is planned to commence. \nAll OLE participants and study sites will be kept blinded to prior drug assignment until the end \nof the OLE period to protect study integrity. \nFor drug arms that demonstrate potential for clinical benefit, participants from a concurrent \nnegative drug arm(s) may have the option of enrolling into an open OLE period after the drug-\nspecific washout period from their last double-blind dose. \nParticipants entering the OLE will follow the drug-specific schedule of visits for the OLE in each \ndrug-specific appendix. \nAccess to study drug may be terminated if any of the following occur: a) the study drug arm is \nterminated due to lack of efficacy and/or safety concerns; b) the medication is commercially \navailable in the country where the participant lives, i.e., the participant can obtain medication \nfrom a government sponsored or private health program; or c) therapeutic alternatives become \navailable in the local market.  Furthermore, the sponsor can terminate the OLE at any time for \nany reason."

For example, if a participant enters the study unaware of their \nmutation status (when allowed), but later learns that they are mutation negative, they \nwould be discontinued from the study. \nIf a participant discontinues early from a double-blind or OLE treatment period, every effort will \nbe made to complete all study assessments, as applicable, at an Early Termination visit.  These \nassessments would not be completed for participants who are withdrawn because they \nbecome unblinded to genetic status and are found to be mutation negative. \nIf a participant discontinues early from the CRI period, no additional testing or termination \nprocedures are required, unless deemed necessary by the sponsor medical monitoring team. \n*Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period: Any participant that discontinues from treatment due to \nsafety reasons or inability to continue treatment and/or key study procedures will be \nencouraged to continue with any assessments and measures able to be performed based upon \nthe assessment schedule.  The assessments will be determined based on discussion with the \nsite principal investigator and sponsor. \n4.4.2 Replacement of Participants  \nEnrollment for each study drug arm will be ongoing until all groups within the study drug arm \nare filled.  Participants may be replaced if they withdraw prior to randomization. \n Transfer of Participants between Sites  \nA participant may request a transfer to a different DIAN-TU site if they relocate or if transfer to \na new site will enable improved compliance with all study visits and procedures.  Should the \ntrial be closed at a DIAN-TU site, participants from the closing site would be offered the option \nof remaining in the study and transferring to another site to complete study procedures.   \nParticipants transferring to another site must continue to be administered the same country-\nspecific language and locally adapted cognitive and clinical assessments as they had been \ncompleting at their prior site for consistency in data collection."

For participants who have not been provided with their mutation status, the staff will be \nencouraged not to make assumptions about genetic status or group assignment within a study \ndrug arm when adverse events (AEs) are reported.  Genetic status will be confirmed for entry \ninto any OLE period. \nShould any drug arm continue into an open-label extension period, treatment assignment from \nthe double-blind period may remain blinded to investigators and participants based on the \ngoals of the OLE period."

Only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug is essential for \nthe immediate clinical management or welfare of a specific participant, may the investigator \nunblind a participant’s treatment assignment. \nPrior to any unblinding, the investigator is strongly advised to discuss options with the PAL, \nMedical Director or designee.  As soon as possible, and without revealing the participant’s study \ndrug assignment (unless important to the safety of participants remaining in the study), the \ninvestigator must notify the sponsor if the blind is broken for any reason and the investigator \nwas unable to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding.  The investigator will record in source \ndocumentation the date and reason for revealing the blinded treatment assignment for that \nparticipant. \n Concomitant Medications \nAll concomitant medication taken during the study must be recorded on the Concomitant \nMedication electronic case report form (eCRF).  Participants will be instructed to consult the \ninvestigator or other appropriate study personnel at the site before initiation of any new \nmedications or supplements and before changing dose(s) of any current concomitant \nmedications or supplements. \nTo approximate standard of care for AD, use of certain approved treatments for AD is permitted \nin this study, but use of additional anti-amyloid therapies i.e. Aduhelm™ (aducanumab), are \nexclusionary and may not be used during trial participation.  This section provides additional \nguidance on managing concomitant medication use during the trial.

The inclusion of specific procedures and \ntiming for completion are described in the respective protocol appendices. \n Procedures \n6.1.1 Participant Informed Consent \nPrior to any study procedures or study-related activities, an IRB or IEC approved Informed \nConsent Form (ICF) must be signed and dated by the participant (and/or caregiver/legally \nauthorized representative if the participant is cognitively impaired) and by the study partner (if \nrequired).  Study staff must document the informed consent process in the participant’s source \ndocument.  A copy of the signed and dated ICF will be provided to the participant and study \npartner. \nBecause of the complexity of this study design, informed consent may occur in two steps when \nmore than one drug is recruiting simultaneously.  In addition, a separate informed consent will \nbe obtained for CRI and/or OLE periods. \nFor participants enrolling into the CRI period, an ICF specific to the CRI period will be used.  The \nCRI ICF will provide detailed information on study design, duration, number and timing of visits \nand procedures, and potential side effects associated with drugs that target amyloid-β or tau, \nand intent for participants to enroll in a study drug arm when one becomes available.  It will \nalso include the main requirements of future potential drug arm(s) (e.g., duration, frequency of \nprocedures, etc.).  The CRI ICF will explain that participants who continue to meet eligibility \ncriteria may be randomized to a study drug arm once a drug arm is open.  The ICF should be \nclear that there is the potential to be excluded from the study drug arm if any entry criteria are \nnot met and it is in the best interest of the participant not to participate.  Participants will be re-\nconsented prior to enrollment to a study drug arm. \nFor participants enrolling into a treatment period when more than one drug arm is enrolling, a \nmain ICF and supplemental drug-specific ICF may both be used.  The main ICF will include a \ndescription of the overall study including an overview of possible side effects of the study drugs \nand differences between study procedures for the different study drug arms.  Participants \nsigning the main ICF agree to screening and randomization and indicate their intention to enter \nthe study.  After randomization, a supplemental study drug arm-specific ICF document may be \nreviewed with and signed by the participant (and/or caregiver/legally authorized representative \nif the participant is cognitively impaired).  This supplemental ICF will contain additional details \nabout the procedures, risks and benefits of the specific study drug arm.  Participants and their \ncaregivers will have the opportunity to review the main and all supplemental ICFs before they \nsign the main study informed consent.  This two-step approach is needed to keep the ICF \nconcise as participants will only be assigned to one study drug arm, and also keeps confidential"

See Appendix \n1, Cognitive Run-in Period, for the specific assessments that are required at each visit. \nOnce a drug arm is open, participants will have a screening visit (V1) conducted either in their \nhome by a home health nurse, or at the DIAN-TU site, to collect safety labs and to reassess the \nsuitability of the participant for entry into the trial (Section 6.3.2). \n6.3.2 General Platform Procedures for Screening (Visit 1) in Double-Blind Treatment Periods \nThe screening period that immediately precedes enrollment into a study drug arm may last up \nto 8 weeks, starting at the collection of the first screening procedure (e.g., clinical laboratory, \ncognitive testing). \nNote: The schedule of visits for screening (V1) and baseline (V2) identify procedures that do not \nneed to be repeated if collected during the CRI period, e.g., genetic testing, family history, \ndemographic and study partner information, medical and treatment history and assignment of \nstudy-specific participant identification number. \nLocation: Visit 1 procedures may be accomplished at the DIAN-TU site or at the participant’s \nhome or other trial-identified location with the trial-designated home health nurse.  This visit \nalso includes telephone calls with the DIAN-TU site staff.  The participant may be contacted by \ntheir host DIAN-TU site by telephone or during a regular DIAN Observational study visit.  The \nparticipant is given the opportunity to review the informed consent form(s), ask questions and \nobtain answers, and sign the main ICF (if multiple drug arms are enrolling) or the stand-alone \nICF. \nTime/Timing:  Informed consent must be obtained before any other study procedures.  \nInformed consent, family history, demographic information and medical and treatment history \nmay be obtained before the 8-week screening period begins.  Informed consent should be \nobtained from both participant and study partner.  Unless otherwise specified, all other Visit 1 \nprocedures may occur throughout the screening period (2 to 8 weeks before baseline [V2]).  \nIMPORTANT: Results from screening clinical laboratory tests and genetic testing must be \navailable before baseline (V2); blood collection for genetic testing must be completed at least 6 \nweeks before V2 to ensure genetic results are available for baseline randomization.  Genetic \ntesting results from the CRI period may be used.  The screening visit in the home ensures \nparticipant eligibility before travel (if applicable) to the DIAN-TU site for baseline testing and \nrandomization. \nProcedures (all can be performed by DIAN-TU site staff or trial-designated and trained home \nhealth nurse or other staff except as noted-see Global Manual of Operations and The arm-\nspecific DIAN Trials Unit Cognition Core Procedures Manuals for additional details on order and \ntiming of procedures):"

Continuous variables \n(e.g., biomarker values) will be summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard \ndeviation (SD), minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and the maximum.  \nCategorical variables (e.g., presence of absence of an APOE ε4 allele) will be summarized using \nthe number and percentage in each category. \n Safety Analysis \nSafety analysis will be drug-specific and in general include all participants who consent to \nparticipate and are randomized to receive any study-related drugs or placebo and will be \nreported to an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for regular reviews.  The \nfollowing are major safety endpoints that will be analyzed: treatment-emergent adverse events \n(TEAE), serious treatment-emergent AEs, serious drug-related treatment-emergent AEs, \ntreatment-emergent AEs that lead to discontinuation of the study, treatment-emergent AEs \nresulting in death, safety MRIs, laboratory parameters, vital signs and physical examinations.  \nAdverse event reporting will include the severity, onset, duration, relief measures, outcome, \nand relationship to study drug.  Adverse events will be classified using MedDRA preferred \nterms.  Adverse events noted on MRI scans, including ARIA, will be analyzed as will adverse \nevents noted as significant changes or new abnormalities in vital signs, clinical laboratory test \nvalues or ECGs. \n Biomarker Endpoint Statistical Analysis, Power and Sample Size Justification \nEach drug that enters the DIAN-TU platform trial will have biomarker defined interim analyses.  \nThe goal of the interim analyses is to stop or adjust a treatment that is not demonstrating \nsufficient efficacy on the target biomarker.  Each study drug arm will have a target biomarker, a \ntarget biomarker analysis, and a remediation plan should the biomarker analysis demonstrate \nlack of success.  The remediation plan will include dose-adjustment strategies, if appropriate, to \nmaximize the efficacy, if the tolerability and safety profile is acceptable.  If no adjustments are \npossible, then failing the biomarker interim will lead to stopping the regimen for futility.  Each \ndrug-specific appendix will detail the biomarker interim analysis.  The biomarker interim \nanalyses will be used for dose-adjustment, remediation, or stopping a study drug arm for futility \nand will not be used to stop the study for efficacy on the primary endpoint. \nInterim biomarker analyses will be conducted for each study drug arm to assess whether the \nactive study drug is engaging its biological target.  The timing of the interim biomarker analyses \nmay vary for each study drug arm.  At each interim, an analysis will be conducted for the \nbiomarker endpoints.

A CRI period can reduce the effects of temporal fluctuations in performance by \nallowing participants to habituate to the testing process, thereby reducing practice effects, \ndemand characteristics and test anxiety. \nMoreover, results from clinical trials testing the β -secretase enzyme (BACE) inhibitors in those \nwith and at risk for AD have identified evidence of an unanticipated cognitive decline.  A CRI \nperiod offers the opportunity to more easily detect a deleterious drug effect by establishing a \nreliable baseline in participants where the majority of participants in the primary prevention \npopulation are cognitively normal at trial entry.  This is particularly important for those \nparticipants that are much younger than their estimated age of onset where a decline in \ncognition would represent a significant deviation from the expected performance.  This could \nbe very helpful in identifying potential deleterious side effects of therapies at an earlier point \nand reacting appropriately. \nThe CRI period will help to ensure that a sufficient number of active and eligible participants \nqualify for entry into a study drug arm once opened to recruitment. \n2 STUDY DESIGN FOR COGNITIVE RUN-IN PERIOD \nIf no study drug arm is available for immediate enrollment or if a future drug arm is stopped \nprior to the planned completion (e.g., at biomarker interim, drug toxicity), a CRI period may be \nopened for recruitment by the sponsor.  Participants considered for eligibility for the CRI period \ninclude participants 18 to 80 years of age who are either known to have a mutation causing \nAlzheimer’s disease OR who do not know their gene status but are “at-risk” for a dominantly \ninherited Alzheimer’s disease (DIAD) mutation AND who are either: \n• cognitively normal or with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, Clinical \nDementia Rating (CDR) 0 to 1 (inclusive) and within –10 to +10 years of the predicted or \nactual age at cognitive symptom onset (Secondary prevention population); target \nnumber of participants = 500 \n• cognitively normal and within 11 to 25 years younger (−25 to –11) than their estimated \nage at symptom onset (Primary prevention population); target number of participants = \n240"

The first preclinical studies demonstrating reduction in amyloid \nburden were performed in APPV717F (“PDAPP”) transgenic mice over 22 years ago (Schenk et al., \n1999; Bard et al., 2000).  The PDAPP mouse and all other genetic mouse models of AD are \nbased on the mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 that underlie the dominantly inherited forms \nof AD represented in the DIAN cohort.  The preclinical studies in these mouse models are highly \nrelevant to these individuals than to those with sporadic AD. \n Study Drug \nGantenerumab is a fully human IgG1 antibody which binds specifically to aggregated forms of \nAβ (including oligomers, fibrils, and plaques) and targets the amyloid pathology associated with \nAD.  \n Preclinical Data \nGantenerumab is a recombinant, completely human, monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass \ndirected against the Aβ peptide.  It is a novel type of antibody that recognizes a conformational \nepitope of Aβ and binds to both major types of Aβ (Aβ40/42).  Binding characteristics for \ngantenerumab were engineered to achieve specific and highly sensitive recognition of \naggregated Aβ, like the fibrillar assembly structure of the human Aβ peptide, which is the \npredominant component in Aβ plaques.  Gantenerumab recognizes aggregated Aβ with high \naffinity (Kd ~ 0.5 nM) as determined in vitro.  Specificity was demonstrated for native human Aβ \nplaques on brain sections.  The minimal effective concentration for staining of human Aβ \nplaques was determined to be 10 ng/mL (0.07 nM). \nIn functional assays gantenerumab induced cellular phagocytosis of human Aβ deposits in AD \nbrain slices when co-cultured with primary human macrophages and neutralized oligomeric \nAβ42-mediated inhibitory effects on long-term potentiation in rat brain.  In \nAPP751swedishxPS2N141I transgenic mice, gantenerumab showed sustained binding to \ncerebral Aβ and, upon chronic treatment, significantly reduced small Aβ plaques by recruiting \nmicroglia and prevented new plaque formation.  Unlike other Aβ antibodies, gantenerumab did \nnot alter plasma Aβ suggesting undisturbed systemic clearance of soluble Aβ.  Overall, \ngantenerumab preferentially interacts with aggregated Aβ in the brain and lowers Aβ by \neliciting effector cell-mediated clearance (Bohrmann et al., 2012; Ostrowitzki et al., 2012). \nEffective brain penetration and binding to Aβ plaques was demonstrated in a double-transgene \nmouse model expressing AD-related mutations that display a pronounced amyloidosis \nphenotype.  Gantenerumab showed significant Aβ plaque binding up to nine weeks, indicating"

In this study, participants received a single dose of \ngantenerumab at the following doses and routes: 60 mg by IV infusion, 75 mg SC injection, or \n150 mg SC injection.  Gantenerumab was generally well tolerated when administered SC. \nJP22474 \nStudy JP22474 was a Phase I SAD study designed to investigate safety, tolerability, PK and PD \nafter IV infusion of gantenerumab in Japanese AD patients.

Due to findings of “vasogenic edema” and “microbleeds” \non brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities or \nARIA) which occurred in some patients in cohort 4 (gantenerumab 200 mg or placebo), it was \ndecided to terminate dosing for all patients on June 9, 2008.  At that time, 16 patients were \nreceiving 200 mg of gantenerumab, and 4 patients were receiving placebo.  These patients had \nreceived between 2 to 5 doses each.  When the patients were then genotyped for APOE, APOE4 \ncarrier status emerged as a risk factor for the occurrence of these MRI findings, as has been \nreported for bapineuzumab.  The MRI findings are described further below.  Otherwise, \ngantenerumab was well tolerated in NN19866."

The study was initiated using the \nlyophilized formulation (generation 2 [G2]) and transitioned to the high concentration liquid \nformulation ([HCLF], generation 3 [G3]) as detailed below. \nThis dosing regimen was investigated in heterozygous carriers and non-carriers of APOE4 in the \nWN25203 (Scarlet RoAD) trial with an acceptable safety profile.  In WN25203, the dose \nadministered to homozygous APOE4 carriers was 105 mg Q4W SC. \nThe starting dose of 225 mg of the G2 formulation in the DIAN-TU-001 study, including \nparticipants homozygous for the APOE4 allele was justified based on the following \nconsiderations: \n• The DIAN-TU-001 study applied similar MRI monitoring scheme to WN25203 and \nWN28745 with a predefined ARIA related intervention algorithm  \n• All new ARIA findings were reviewed by the Project Arm Leader (PAL), Medical Director \nor designee who advised the site on whether a more conservative approach should be \nconsidered than defined in the ARIA related intervention algorithm (Section 1.14) \n• Participants recruited into the trial were generally at an early stage of the disease, i.e., \nat an earlier clinical stage or a similar stage as requested for prodromal and mild \n(sporadic) AD patients in the ongoing WN25203 and WN28745 trials \n• The dominantly inherited mutation carrier status (rather than APOE genotype) was the \npredominant risk for AD and for amyloid deposition in the DIAN-TU population \n• Given the PET data obtained in the MAD study (Study NN19866) where decreases in the \namyloid plaque burden were observed, the dosage selected based on systemic overall \nexposure was expected to reduce the plaque burden relative to placebo \nBased on results of a pre-planned futility analyses in the concurrent gantenerumab study \n(WN25203) and similar monoclonal antibody (aducanumab) data emerging at much higher \ndoses in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease following approval of Amendment 5, all participants \ninitiated up–titration which included transition to the HCLF G3 formulation.   \n \n \n \nCCI"

The amount of amyloid removal is an important goal \nto increase the probability of cognitive improvement and clinical response.  Recent findings \nfrom the DIAN-TU-001 double-blind period showed that gantenerumab reduced amyloid \nplaques in a dose-dependent fashion.  The effect of gantenerumab on amyloid removal \nassessed by PiB-PET was more pronounced at higher doses (1200 mg gantenerumab [G3 \nformulation]).  In addition, the data suggested that higher doses resulted in larger treatment \neffects in downstream biomarkers such as CSF total tau and CSF ptau181 (Salloway et al., 2021). \nThus, the higher doses to be administered in DIAD during the OLE period (up to 1500 mg Q2W) \nare expected to be more effective on plaque reduction and on downstream biomarkers (i.e., \ndecreased CSF measures of tau and neurodegeneration). \nDuring the DIAN-TU-001 double-blind period, the safety profile of gantenerumab was consistent \nwith trials in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, and no new safety issues were identified .  Adverse \nevents reported more frequently (> 20%) with gantenerumab than placebo were injection -site \nreactions, nasopharyngitis, and back pain; however, most AEs were of mild intensity and not \nlimiting the maintenance of participants in the long-term treatment trial.  \nAmyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) events also represent an adverse event of \nconcern in the development of immune-therapeutics targeting Aβ in the brain \n (Sperling et al., \n2012).  These changes may include micro-hemorrhage (MCH), superficial siderosis (SS), and \nvasogenic edema/effusion (ARIA-E).  During the DIAN-TU-001 placebo-controlled period, ARIA-E \nevents were observed in 19.2% (10/52) of the gantenerumab group.  ARIA-E findings were \nmostly asymptomatic (7/10); if symptoms occurred, they were mild in nature (headache, \nvertigo and ear pain) and resolved.  ARIA-E was more frequent during symptomatic stages of \nthe disease (6/10, CDR>0), and at the higher doses (8/10, 900mg-1200mg [G3 formulation]).  \nThe mean time for ARIA-E resolution was 10.4±6.2 weeks.  ARIA-E events did not increase the \nprobability of participant discontinuation.  \nIn the OLE phase of Studies WN25203 and WN28745, gantenerumab G3, in doses of up to 1200 \nmg SC Q4W for up to approximately 4.5 years was safe and well tolerated by patients with AD. \nRefer to the IB for more information on the risk/benefit profile of gantenerumab. \n \n \n \n \n \nCCI"

MRI scans will be \nanalyzed for ARIA changes at the Mayo Clinic Aging and Dementia Imaging Research (Mayo-\nADIR).  The number of microhemorrhages (ARIA-H, including both hemorrhages and \nhemosiderin deposits) and size of areas of edema (ARIA-E) will be monitored at entry and \nthroughout the trial.  Any occurrence of ARIA-E will trigger an acute blood (plasma) collection \nand collection every 4 weeks thereafter to monitor biomarker changes until the occurrence \nresolves.  In addition, blood will be collected from all participants approximately every 12 \nweeks to identify biomarkers that correlate with, or are predictive of, ARIA-E. Incidence with \nassociated risks of ARIA on therapy will be compared to placebo findings.  \nA report of new ARIA changes in a participant will trigger a review by the DIAN-TU Medical \nDirector or designee, Project Arm Leader (PAL), and site principal investigator.  No further \ndosing will occur until this review is completed.  This review will include contact with the \nparticipant or caregiver to assess for any symptoms associated with the changes and discussion \nwith the central readers.  The PAL, as a site independent neurologist, will help ensure \nconsistency of decisions within a study drug arm across sites during the study.  See tables in \nSection 1.14 for ARIA algorithms.  The DIAN-TU Medical Director will ensure consistency across \nstudy drug arms and will have final decision-making authority on changes in dosing of study \ndrug or safety monitoring; this decision should be received by the site within 7 days of the \nreport of the new ARIA changes, but no later than the day prior to the planned administration \nof the next dose of medication.  A similar process will be followed if a follow-up MRI shows \nworsening of a previously reported ARIA.   The schedule of visits includes frequent MRI scans to \nassess for ARIA changes.   \nSafety MRIs will be performed at the same field strength throughout the study, and if possible, \non the same scanner.  All MRIs will be centrally read. \nThe MRI schedule may be changed according to the ARIA-related dosing intervention algorithm \n(see tables in Section 1.14) or per individual request by the site principal investigator or \ndelegated sub-investigator, Project Arm Leader (PAL), or Medical Director or designee. \nRefer to prior amendments for details regarding the MRI schedule relative to dosing in the \ndouble-blind period. \nFor the OLE Period, all participants will have Safety MRIs performed (Figure 1) at the following \ntime points:  \n• Titration Period: prior to each up-titration"
