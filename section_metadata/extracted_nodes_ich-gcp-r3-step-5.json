Introduction \nGood Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international, ethical, scientific and quality standard for the conduct \nof trials that involve human participants. Clinical trials conducted in accordance with this standard will \nhelp to assure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected; that the conduct \nis consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki; and that the \nclinical trial results are reliable. The term “trial conduct” in this document includes processes from \nplanning to reporting, including planning, initiating, performing, recording, oversight, evaluation, \nanalysis and reporting activities as appropriate. \nThe objective of this ICH GCP Guideline is to provide a unified standard to facilitate the mutual \nacceptance of clinical trial data for ICH member countries and regions by applicable regulatory \nauthorities. \nThis guideline builds on key concepts outlined in ICH E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical \nStudies. This includes fostering a quality culture and proactively designing quality into clinical trials and \ndrug development planning, identifying factors critical to trial quality, engaging interested parties, as \nappropriate, and using a proportionate risk-based approach. \nClinical trials vary widely in scale, complexity and cost. Careful evaluation of critical to quality factors \ninvolved in each trial and the risks associated with these factors will help ensure efficiency by focusing \non activities critical to achieving the trial objectives. \nGuideline scope \nThis guideline applies to interventional clinical trials of investigational products that are intended to be \nsubmitted to regulatory authorities. The Principles of GCP in this guideline may also be applicable to \nother interventional clinical trials of investigational products\n1 that are not intended to support \nmarketing authorisation applications in accordance with local requirements. \nThe Annexes provide the basis for the appropriate interpretation and application of the principles and \nshould therefore be appropriately considered; however, various approaches to the provisions in the \nAnnexes may be considered provided they are justified and achieve the intended purpose of the \napplication of the principles. \nThis guideline encourages a risk-based and proportionate approach to the conduct of a clinical trial. \nGuideline structure \nThis ICH GCP Guideline is composed of Principles and Annexes that expand on the principles, with \nspecific details for different types of clinical trials. The principles are intended to apply across clinical \ntrial types and settings and to remain relevant as technological and methodological advances occur. \nThe principles outlined in this guideline may be satisfied using differing approaches and should be \napplied to fit the intended purpose of the clinical trial. \nAnnex 1, including its Appendices, is intended to provide information on how the Principles can be \nappropriately applied to clinical trials. Additional annexes may be developed to respond to the needs of \ninterested parties and to address emerging innovations in trial design and conduct. This guideline \nshould be read in conjunction with other ICH guidelines relevant to the design and conduct of clinical \ntrials, including multiregional trials. \n \n1 For the purpose of this guideline, the term “investigational products” should be considered synonymous with \ndrugs, medicines, medicinal products, vaccines and biological products."

Principles of ICH GCP  \nClinical trials are a fundamental part of clinical research that support the development of new \nmedicines or uses of existing medicines. Well-designed and conducted clinical trials help answer key \nquestions in healthcare and drug development. Their results are essential for evidence-based \nhealthcare decisions. Trials with inadequate design and/or poorly conducted trials may place participant \nsafety at risk, yield inadequate or unreliable results and are unethical. They waste resources and the \nefforts and time of investigators and participants. \nThe Principles of GCP are designed to be flexible and applicable to a broad range of clinical trials. This \nguideline, along with ICH E8(R1), encourages thoughtful consideration and planning to address specific \nand potentially unique aspects of an individual clinical trial. This includes evaluation of trial \ncharacteristics, such as the design elements, the investigational product being evaluated, the medical \ncondition being addressed, the characteristics of the participants, the setting in which the clinical trial \nis being conducted, and the type of data being collected. Careful consideration of factors relevant to \nensuring trial quality is needed for each clinical trial. \nThe principles are intended to support efficient approaches to trial design and conduct. For example, \ndigital health technologies, such as wearables and sensors, may expand the possible approaches to \ntrial conduct. Such technologies can be incorporated into existing healthcare infrastructures and enable \nthe use of a variety of relevant data sources in clinical trials. This will aid in keeping clinical trial \nconduct in line with advancing science and technological developments. The use of technology in the \nconduct of clinical trials should be adapted to fit the participant characteristics and the particular trial \ndesign. This guideline is intended to be media neutral to enable the use of different technologies. \nThe design and conduct of the clinical trial may be supported by obtaining the perspectives of \ninterested parties, such as patients and their communities, patient advocacy groups and healthcare \nprofessionals. Their input can help to reduce unnecessary complexity, improve feasibility and increase \nthe likelihood of meaningful trial outcomes. The use of innovative trial designs and technologies may \nenable the inclusion of a wider and more diverse population of participants and thereby broaden the \napplicability of trial outcomes. \nClinical trials should be designed to protect the rights, safety and well-being of participants and assure \nthe reliability of results. Quality by design should be implemented to identify the factors (i.e., data and \nprocesses) that are critical to ensuring trial quality and the risks that threaten the integrity of those \nfactors and ultimately the reliability of the trial results. Clinical trial processes and risk mitigation \nstrategies implemented to support the conduct of the trial should be proportionate to the importance of \nthe data being collected and the risks to trial participant safety and the reliability of trial results. Trial \ndesigns should be operationally feasible and avoid unnecessary complexity.  \nThe overarching principles provide a flexible framework for clinical trial conduct. They are structured to \nprovide guidance throughout the life cycle of the clinical trial. These principles are applicable to trials \ninvolving human participants. The principles are interdependent and should be considered in their \ntotality to assure ethical trial conduct and reliable results."

The informed consent \nprocess should include the following: \n(a) Prior to consenting and enrolling participants, the investigator should have the IRB/IEC’s \ndocumented approval/favourable opinion of the informed consent materials and process;  \n(b) The information should be as clear and concise as possible, use simple language and \navoid unnecessary volume and complexity. This is to ensure that the trial participants or \ntheir legally acceptable representatives have an adequate understanding of the \nobjectives of the trial, alternative treatments, potential benefits and risks, burdens, their \nrights and what is expected of the participants to be able to make an informed decision \nas to their participation in the trial; \n(c) Varied approaches (e.g., text, images, videos and other interactive methods) may be \nused in the informed consent process including for providing information to the \nparticipant. The characteristics of the potential trial population (e.g., participants may \nlack familiarity with computerised systems) and the suitability of the method of obtaining \nconsent should be taken into consideration when developing the informed consent \nmaterials and process. When computerised systems are used to obtain informed consent, \ntrial participants may be given the option to use a paper-based approach as an \nalternative. \n(d) Obtaining consent remotely may be considered where appropriate. \n(e) Whether the informed consent process takes place in person or remotely, the \ninvestigator should assure themselves of the identity of the participant (or legally \nacceptable representative) in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. \n2.8.2 The participant or the participant’s legally acceptable representative should be informed in a \ntimely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the participant’s \nwillingness to continue trial participation. The communication of this information and \nconfirmation of the willingness to continue trial participation should be documented.  \nNew information that could impact a participant’s willingness to continue participation should \nbe assessed to determine if re-consent is needed (e.g., depending on the stage of the trial, \nconsideration should be given to whether the new information is relevant only to new \nparticipants or to existing participants). If re-consent is needed (e.g., information on emerging \nsafety concerns), new information should be clearly identified in the revised informed consent"

By signing the consent form, the investigator or delegated \ninvestigator site staff attests that the informed consent was freely given by the participant or \nthe participant’s legally acceptable representative and the consent information was accurately \nexplained to and apparently understood by the participant or the participant’s legally \nacceptable representative. The informed consent process may involve a physical or an \nelectronic signature and date (see the glossary term “signature”). \n2.8.8 In emergency situations, when prior consent of  the participant is not possible, the consent of \nthe participant’s legally acceptable representative, if present, should be requested. When prior \nconsent of the participant is not possible and the participant’s legally acceptable representative \nis not available, enrolment of the participant should require measures described in the protocol \nand/or elsewhere, with documented approval/favourable opinion by the IRB/IEC, to protect the \nparticipant’s rights, safety and well-being and to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory \nrequirements.

Important protocol deviations are a subset of protocol deviations \nthat may significantly impact the completeness, accuracy and/or reliability of the trial data or \nthat may significantly affect a participant’s rights, safety or well-being. \n3.9.4 Decisions related to the trial should be appropriately assessed for their impact on participant’s \nrights, safety and well-being and the reliability of trial results. Risks related to such decisions \nshould be suitably managed throughout the planning, conduct and reporting of the trial. \n3.9.5 The range and extent of oversight measures  should be fit for purpose and tailored to the \ncomplexity of and risks associated with the trial. The selection and oversight of investigators \nand service providers are fundamental features of the oversight process. Oversight by the \nsponsor includes quality assurance and quality control processes relating to the trial-related \nactivities of investigators and service providers.  \n3.9.6 The sponsor should ensure appropriate and timely escalation and follow-up of issues to allow \nthe implementation of appropriate actions in a timely manner. \n3.9.7 The sponsor may consider establishing an IDMC to assess the progress of a clinical trial, \nincluding the safety data and the efficacy endpoints, at intervals and to recommend to the \nsponsor whether to continue, modify or stop a trial.  \n3.9.8 Where appropriate, sponsors may also establish an endpoint assessment/adjudication \ncommittee in certain trials to review endpoints reported by investigators to determine \nwhether the endpoints meet protocol-specified criteria. To minimise bias, such committees \nshould typically be blinded to the assigned treatments when performing their assessments, \nregardless of whether the trial itself is conducted in a blinded manner. \n3.9.9 Committees established for purposes that could impact participant safety or the reliability of \ntrial results should include members with relevant expertise and with managed conflicts of \ninterest, have written operating procedures (e.g., charters) and document their decisions.  \n3.10 Quality management  \nThe sponsor should implement an appropriate system to manage quality throughout all stages of the \ntrial process. Quality management includes the design and implementation of efficient clinical trial \nprotocols, including tools and procedures for trial conduct (including for data collection and \nmanagement), in order to ensure the protection of participants’ rights, safety and well-being and the \nreliability of trial results. The sponsor should adopt a proportionate and risk-based approach to quality \nmanagement, which involves incorporating quality into the design of the clinical trial (i.e., quality by \ndesign) and identifying those factors that are likely to have a meaningful impact on participants’ rights, \nsafety and well-being and the reliability of the results (i.e., critical to quality factors as described in ICH \nE8(R1)). The sponsor should describe the quality management approach implemented in the trial in \nthe clinical trial report (see ICH E3 Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports)."

Risks should be considered across the processes and \nsystems, including computerised systems, used in the clinical trial (e.g., trial design, participant \nselection, informed consent process, randomisation, blinding, investigational product administration, \ndata handling and service provider activities).  \n3.10.1.2 Risk evaluation  \nThe sponsor should evaluate identified risks and existing controls in place to mitigate the risk by \nconsidering:  \n(a) The likelihood of harm/hazard occurring; \n(b) The extent to which such ha rm/hazard would be detectable; \n(c) The impact of such harm/hazard on tria l participant protection and the reliability \nof trial results. \n3.10.1.3 Risk control  \nRisk control should be proportionate to the importance of the risk to participants’ rights, safety and \nwell-being and the reliability of trial results. Risk mitigation activities may be incorporated, for \nexample, in protocol design and implementation, monitoring plans, agreements between parties \ndefining roles and responsibilities, and training.  \nWhere relevant, the sponsor should set pre-specified acceptable ranges (e.g., quality tolerance limits at \nthe trial level) to support the control of risks to critical to quality factors. These pre-specified ranges \nreflect limits that when exceeded have the potential to impact participant safety or the reliability of \ntrial results. Where deviation beyond these ranges is detected, an evaluation should be performed to \ndetermine if there is a possible systemic issue and if action is needed.  \n3.10.1.4 Risk communication  \nThe sponsor should document and communicate the identified risks and mitigating activities, if \napplicable, to those who are involved in taking action or are affected by such activities. Communication \nalso facilitates risk review and continual improvement during clinical trial conduct.  \n3.10.1.5 Risk review  \nThe sponsor should periodically review risk control measures to ascertain whether the implemented \nquality management activities remain effective and relevant, taking into account emerging knowledge \nand experience. Additional risk control measures may be implemented as needed. \n3.10.1.6 Risk reporting \nThe sponsor should summarise and report important quality issues (including instances in which \nacceptable ranges are exceeded, as detailed in section 3.10.1.3) and the remedial actions taken and \ndocument them in the clinical trial report (see ICH E3)."

Within clinical trials, monitoring and \ndata management processes are the main quality control activities. Where appropriate, quality control \nactivities may also be applied to facilities outside of investigator sites (e.g., central image reading \nfacilities). \n3.11.4 Monitoring  \nThe aim of monitoring is to ensure the participants’ rights, safety and well-being and the reliability of \ntrial results as the trial progresses. Monitoring is one of the principal quality control activities. \nMonitoring involves a broad range of activities including, but not limited to, communication with \ninvestigator sites, verification of the investigator and investigator site staff qualifications and site \nresources, training and review of trial documents and information using a range of approaches \nincluding source data review, source data verification, data analytics and visits to institutional facilities \nundertaking trial-related activities. Some of these monitoring activities (e.g., centralised monitoring) \nmay be conducted by different methods and persons with different roles (e.g., data scientist). \nHowever, monitoring should be performed by persons not involved in the clinical conduct of the trial at \nthe site being monitored. The monitoring approach should consider the activities and services involved, \nincluding decentralised settings, and be included in the monitoring plan. Monitors and other trial staff \nshould adhere to data protection and confidentiality requirements in accordance with applicable \nregulatory requirements, institution policy and established data security standards.  \nMonitoring may include site monitoring (performed on-site and/or remotely) and centralised \nmonitoring, depending on the monitoring strategy and the design of the clinical trial. \nThe sponsor should determine the appropriate extent and nature of monitoring based on identified \nrisks. Factors such as the objective, purpose, design, complexity, blinding, number of trial participants, \ninvestigational product, current knowledge of the safety profile and endpoints of the trial should be \nconsidered.  \n3.11.4.1 Investigator site monitoring  \n(a) Monitoring may be performed in relation to the clinical trial activities at the \ninvestigator sites (including their pharmacies and local laboratories, as \nappropriate). The frequency of monitoring activities should also be determined \nbased on identified risks. Monitoring activities and their frequency should be \nmodified as appropriate using knowledge gained.  \n(b) This monitoring activity may be perfor med on-site and/or remotely depending on \nthe nature of the activity and its objectives.  \n(c) Monitoring may include remote and secure, direct read-only access to source \nrecords, other data acquisition tools and essential record retention systems.  \n3.11.4.2 Centralised monitoring  \n(a) Centralised monitoring is an evaluati on of accumulated data, performed in a \ntimely manner, by the sponsor’s qualified and trained persons (e.g., medical \nmonitor, data scientist/data manager, biostatistician)."

Investigator’s Brochure  \nA.1 Introduction  \nThe Investigator’s Brochure (IB) is a compilation of the clinical and nonclinical data on the \ninvestigational product(s) (1) that are relevant to the study of the product(s) in human participants. Its \npurpose is to provide the investigators and others involved in the trial with the information to facilitate \ntheir understanding of the rationale for and their compliance with many key features of the protocol, \nsuch as the dose, dose frequency/interval, methods of administration and safety monitoring \nprocedures. \nA.1.1 Development of the Investigator’s Brochure \nGenerally, the sponsor is responsible for ensuring that an up-to-date IB is developed. In the case of an \ninvestigator-initiated trial, the sponsor-investigator should determine whether a brochure is available \nfrom the product license/marketing authorisation holder. If the investigational product is provided by \nthe sponsor-investigator, then they should provide the necessary information to the investigator site \nstaff. Where permitted by regulatory authorities, the current scientific information such as a basic \nproduct information brochure (e.g., summary of product characteristics package leaflet, or labelling) \nmay be an appropriate alternative, provided that it includes current, comprehensive and detailed \ninformation on all aspects of the investigational product that might be of importance to the \ninvestigator. If an authorised medicinal product is being studied for a new use (i.e., a new indication), \nan IB specific to that new use should be prepared unless there is a rationale for only one IB. The IB \nshould be reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary in compliance with a sponsor’s \ndocumented procedures. More frequent revision may be appropriate depending on the stage of \ndevelopment and the generation of relevant new information. Relevant new information may be so \nimportant that it needs to be communicated to the investigators and possibly to the institutional review \nboards/independent ethics committees (IRBs/IECs) and/or regulatory authorities before it is included \nin a revised IB.  \nA.1.2 Reference safety informatio n and risk-benefit assessment \nThe reference safety information (RSI) contained in the IB provides an important reference point for \nexpedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) in the clinical trial. \nThis RSI should include a list of adverse reactions, including information on their frequency and nature. \nThis list should be used for determining the expectedness of a suspected serious adverse reaction and \nsubsequently whether reporting needs to be expedited in accordance with applicable regulatory \nrequirements (see section 3.13.2(c)). \nThe IB also provides insight to support the clinical management of the participants during the course of \nthe clinical trial. The information should be presented in a concise, simple, objective, balanced and \nnon-promotional form that enables a clinician or potential investigator to understand it and make their \nown unbiased risk-benefit assessment of the appropriateness of the proposed trial. For this reason, a \nmedically qualified person should be involved in the generation of an IB, but the contents of the IB \nshould be approved by the disciplines that generated the described data. \n \n(1) For the purpose of this guideline, the term investigational products should be considered synonymous \nwith drugs, medicines, medicinal products, vaccines and biological products."

It is \nexpected that the type and extent of information available will vary with the stage of development of \nthe investigational product.  \nThe IB should include: \nA.2.1 Title Page  \nThis should provide the sponsor’s name, the identity of each investigational product (i.e., research \nnumber, chemical or approved generic name and trade name(s) where legally permissible and desired \nby the sponsor) and the release date. It is also suggested that an edition number and a reference to \nthe number and date of the edition it supersedes be provided along with the cut-off date for data \ninclusion in the version. Where appropriate, a signature page may be included.  \nA.2.2 Confidentiality statement  \nThe sponsor may wish to include a statement instructing the investigator and other recipients to treat \nthe IB as a confidential document for the sole information and use of the investigator/institution, \ninvestigator site staff, regulatory authorities and the IRB/IEC.  \nA.3 Contents of the Investigator’s Brochure  \nThe IB should contain the following sections, each with literature references (publications or reports) \nincluded at the end of each chapter, where appropriate: \nA.3.1 Table of contents  \nA.3.2 Summary  \nA brief summary (preferably not exceeding two pages) should be given, highlighting the significant \nphysical, chemical, pharmaceutical, pharmacological, toxicological, pharmacokinetic, metabolic and \nclinical information available that is relevant to the stage of clinical development of the investigational \nproduct.  \nA.3.3 Introduction  \nA brief introductory statement should be provided that contains the chemical name (and generic and \ntrade name(s) when approved) of the investigational product(s); all active ingredients; the \npharmacological class of the investigational product(s) and its expected position within this class (e.g., \nadvantages); the rationale for performing research with the investigational product(s); and the \nanticipated prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic indication(s). Finally, the introductory statement \nshould provide the general approach to be followed in evaluating the investigational product.  \nA.3.4 Physical, chemical and pharmace utical properties and formulation  \nA description should be provided of the investigational product substance(s) (including the chemical \nand/or structural formula(e)), and a brief summary should be given of the relevant physical, chemical \nand pharmaceutical properties.  \nTo permit appropriate safety measures to be taken in the course of the trial, a description of the \nformulation(s) to be used, including excipients, should be provided and justified if clinically relevant. \nInstructions for the storage and handling of the dosage form(s) should also be given."

This understanding should be based on the available physical, chemical, \npharmaceutical, pharmacological, toxicological and clinical information on the investigational \nproduct(s). Guidance should also be provided to the clinical investigator on the recognition and \ntreatment of possible overdose and adverse drug reactions that is based on previous clinical and \nnonclinical experience and on the pharmacology of the investigational product. \nAppendix B. Clinical trial protocol and protocol amendment(s)  \nClinical trials should be described in a clear, concise and operationally feasible protocol. The protocol \nshould be designed in such a way as to minimise unnecessary complexity and to mitigate or eliminate \nimportant risks to the rights, safety, and well-being of trial participants and the reliability of data. \nProtocol development processes should incorporate input from relevant interested parties, where \nappropriate. Building adaptability into the protocol, for example, by including acceptable ranges for \nspecific protocol provisions, can reduce the number of deviations or in some instances the requirement \nfor a protocol amendment.

The nature and \nextent of those records generated and maintained are dependent on the trial design, its \nconduct, application of risk proportionate approaches and the importance and relevance of \nthat record to the trial.  \nC.1.2 Determining which records are essential will be  based on consideration of the guidance in this \nappendix.  \nC.1.3 The essential records permit and contribute to the evaluation of the conduct of a trial in \nrelation to the compliance of the investigator and sponsor with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) \nand applicable regulatory requirements and the reliability of the results produced. The \nessential records are used as part of the investigator oversight and sponsor oversight \n(including monitoring) of the trial. These records are used by the sponsor’s independent audit \nfunction and during inspections by regulatory authority(ies) to assess the trial conduct and \nthe reliability of the trial results. Certain essential records may also be reviewed by the \ninstitutional review board/independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC) in accordance with \napplicable regulatory requirements. The investigator/institution should have access to and the \nability to maintain the essential records generated by the investigator/institution before and \nduring the conduct of the trial and retain them in accordance with applicable regulatory \nrequirements."

These repositories \nmay be referred to as a trial master file (TMF). The repository held by the \ninvestigator/institution may also be referred to as the investigator site file (ISF).  \nC.2.4 The sponsor and investigator/institution should maintain a record of where essential records \nare located, including source records. The storage system(s) used during the trial and for \narchiving (irrespective of the type of media used) should provide for appropriate \nidentification, version history, search and retrieval of trial records. \nC.2.5 The sponsor and investigator/institution should ensure that the essential records are collected \nand filed in a timely manner, which can greatly assist in the successful management of a trial. \nSome essential records should generally be in place prior to the start of the trial and may be \nsubsequently updated during the trial. \nC.2.6 The sponsor and investigator/institution should retain the essential records in a way that \nensures that they remain complete, readable and readily available and are directly accessible \nupon request by regulatory authorities, monitors and auditors. Alteration to the essential \nrecords should be traceable. \nC.2.7 The sponsor and investigator/institution should ensure the retention of the essential records \nrequired to fulfil their responsibility. The original records should generally be retained by the \nresponsible party who generated them.  \nC.2.8 In order to fulfil their responsibilities in the conduct of the trial, the sponsor and \ninvestigator/institution may need access to or copies of one another’s relevant essential \nrecords before and during the conduct of the trial. At the end of the trial, each party should \nretain their essential records (see sections 2.12.11 and 3.16.3(a)). The record location may \nvary during the trial depending on the nature of the record. For example, the investigator \nmay access relevant essential records from the sponsor (e.g., suspected unexpected serious \nadverse reactions (SUSAR) reports) via a sponsor-provided portal, and these essential \nrecords would need to be retained by the investigator/institution at the end of the trial.  \nC.2.9 When a copy is used to permanently replac e the original essential record, the copy should \nfulfil the requirements for certified copies. \nC.2.10 Some records are typically maintained and re tained only by the sponsor (e.g., those related \nsolely to sponsor activities such as data analysis) or only by the investigator/institution (e.g., \nthose that contain confidential participant information). Some records may be retained by the \nsponsor and/or the investigator/institution. \nC.2.11 Careful consideration should be given to the sharing of records when there are blinding \nconsiderations and when the records are subject to applicable data protection legislation. For \nthe sharing of essential records with service providers, see section C.2.2."

The adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the \ntreatment. \nAdverse drug reaction (ADR):  \n• In the pre-approval clinical experience with a new investigational product or its new usages \n(particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established): unfavourable and unintended \nresponses, such as a sign (e.g., laboratory results), symptom or disease related to any dose of a \nmedicinal product where a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event \nis a reasonable possibility. The level of certainty about the relatedness of the adverse drug \nreaction to an investigational product will vary.
