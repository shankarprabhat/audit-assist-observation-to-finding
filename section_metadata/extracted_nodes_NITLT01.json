To evaluate and compare the effect(s) of each of the four doses \nof NIR-TLT on depressive symptomatology: antidepressant effect, \nin patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). \nSecondary: \n• B. Compare safety and tolerability at each dose of NIR-TLT. \n• C. Compare the effect(s) of each of the four doses of NIR- TLT \non brain electrophysiology. \n Exploratory: \n• D. To describe the findings visualized in PET, related to the brain \nmetabolism of the participants, before and after receiving the \nintervention under study. \nStudy \nDesign: \nMulti-center, randomized, sham, double-blind. \nThis trial will randomize 112 subjects into 4 equal groups: bilateral \ncontinuous wave (BCW), bilateral pulsed wave (BPW 1 -2) and SHAM. \nAll subjects, investigators (except the study statistician) and outcome \nassessors will be blinded to group assignments. The device operator will \nbe aware of group assignments. \nAll subjects will receive 3 NIR -TLT sessions per week for 6 weeks. A \nfollow-up evaluation will be performed 2 weeks after the end of the study. \nThe treatment will follow these specifications: wavelength 830 nm; \naverage irradiance 54.8 mW / cm2; average fluence of 65.8 J / cm2 \n(according to the parameters used in the ELATED -2 study at MGH with \nthe Omnilux New U device), being the total fluence deli vered: 3.6 kJ \n(bilateral) or 1.8 kJ (unilateral), either on the subject's forehead, at or near \nthe electroencephalography (EEG) sites F3 and F4. \n \nAll NIR-TLT sessions will be 429 seconds (7.15 minutes), regardless of \ngroup assignment. \nStudy \npopulation: \nPatients eligible to participate in the study will be diagnosed with MDD by \nDSM criteria (MINI). Subjects will be between 18 and 75 years of age (not \nyet 76 years of age) on the date of the examination. \nDuration of \nparticipation: \nResearch subjects will remain in the study for 8 weeks. \n(6-week treatment period, plus 2-week follow-up).

    "content": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and disabling condition: 16.2% of the U.S. \npopulation has MDD at some point in life (Kessler et al., 2003). In the United States, depression \nis the third leading cause of years lost to disability or death, after cardiovascular disease and lung \nand breast cancer (Michaud et al., 2006). Despite the availability of effective treatments such as \nantidepressants and psychotherapy, MDD often remains untreated, with only one -fifth of cases \nreceiving adequate treatment (Kessler et al., 2003). In addition, diagnosis and treatment rates for \ndepression among Blacks and Hispanics are less than half the rates observed for Whites (Sclar et \nal., 2008). Hispanics and Blacks have far more concerns regarding the effects of medications on \nquality of life than Whites (Huang et al., 2009). Among Hispanics, the stigma associated with \nreceiving antidepressants is a major concern (Interian et al., 2007). Delayed treatment for \ndepression not only prolongs associated disability, but may re sult in lower rates of response to \nantidepressants (de Diego-Adelino et al., 2009). \n \nThe current standard treatments for MDD are antidepressants and psychotherapy. \nAntidepressants are effective, but their efficacy is often limited by treatment adherence (Lingam \nand Scott, 2002). Psychosocial interventions are generally preferred in primary care \n(Backenstrass et al., 2006), especially among minorities (Givens et al., 2007), but are generally \nnot cost -effective due to the higher upfront costs of providing psychotherapy (Barrett et al.., \n2005). In addition, counseling and psychotherapy are limited in the community because of the \nlack of counselors who are culturally trained and fluent in specific languages (e.g., Spanish). \n \nDue to the limitations of drug treatment and talk therapy, new treatment approaches for \ndepression are needed, especially in primary care and in the community, where several minorities \nare underserved. We propose a new treatment approach for depression based on the u se of \ntranscranial laser therapy (TLT). The treatment consists of bilaterally exposing the forebrain to \nTLT, which can enhance ATP production in depressed subjects. \n \nMajor depressive disorder has been associated with deficits in brain bioenergetic metabolism. In \nan experimental model of depression, chronic stress inhibited the mitochondrial respiratory chain \n(the cellular site for energy production) (Rezin et al., 2008 ). Depressed subjects also have \nsignificantly lower production of ATP (an energy vector) in their muscle tissue and a higher \nincidence of deletions in their mitochondrial DNA (Gardner et al., 2003). Magnetic resonance \nspectroscopy data in subjects with MDD showed that the response to augmentation of a selective \nserotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with triiodothyronine (a thyroid hormone) is associated with \nrestoration of ATP levels in the brain (Iosifescu et al., 2008). \n \nNear infrared light is a non -ionizing electromagnetic wave, is invisible, penetrates the skin and \nskull into brain tissue, is non -invasive (Zhang et al., 2000), dissipates minimally as thermal \nenergy and is absorbed mainly by specific chromophores (Mochizu ki-Oda et al., 2002). The \nbenefits of NIR-TLT are wavelength specific. A mitochondrial enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, \nis the primary chromophore for NIR-TLT with a wavelength of about 830 nm (Eells et al., 2003). \nThe energy absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase leads to increased production of adenosine \ntriphosphate (ATP) through the respiratory chain. Ultimately, the increase in ATP leads to an \nincrease in the cell's energy metabolism, and presumably also activates a signaling cascade that \npromotes cell plasticity and cytoprotection. (Eells et al., 2003)."

In subjects \nwith acute ischemic stroke, acute treatment with NIR-TLT led to a significantly better outcome \ncompared to sham treatment (Lampl et al., 2007). These results were confirmed in a different \ncohort of stroke patients with mild to moderate disease severity (Zivin et al., 2009). Both studies \nin stroke subjects showed no significant difference in the rate of adverse events or serious adverse \nevents between NIR-TLT and sham-treated subjects (Lampl et al., 2007; Zivin et al., 2009). NIR-\nTLT has also been used as a treatment for alopecia (Leavitt et al., 2009) and in animal models \nfor methanol-induced retinal toxicity (Eells et al., 2003). Near -infrared light is already widely \nused for noninvasive assessment of brain function (replacing fMRI in studies of infants and  \nyoung adults, under the name of Near Infrared Spectroscopy), underscoring the relatively low \nrisk of NIR-TLT. The greatest risk of NIR-TLT when using a laser as a light source is associated \nwith accidental exposure of the retina, when beams are projected through the lens, which \nincreases the risk of macular injury (Kim et al., 2007). In our study, we will have multiple \nsafeguards against this risk [See Section 4.9, Completion]. \n \nPreliminary uncontrolled studies in 10 and 4 depressed subjects, respectively, have shown NIR-\nTLT to be safe, effective and well tolerated (Schiffer et al., 2009; Cassano et al., 2015). Our study \noffers a larger sample size, a cleaner design with placebo control (also called sham treatment) \nand tests the efficacy and to lerability of repeated sessions of NIR -TLT. Because NIR -TLT is \nnon-ionizing radiation, multiple sessions, likely necessary for the treatment of depression, are \nexpected to be safe. \n \nThe advantage of the NIR-TLT treatment approach over pharmacotherapy is that adherence can \nbe easily monitored (since the treatment is administered in the clinic) and the patient is not \nrequired to ingest any substances. It is possible that exposure to NIR -TLT is more acceptable \nthan medication use among some minorities. Compared to talk therapy, NIR-TLT has the \nadvantage of not requiring providers with specific cultural expertise or proficiency in a second \nlanguage. Our study will help determine whether NI R-TLT has an antidepressant effect and is \nacceptable in minority populations, thus justifying further study and investment. \n \n \n3.1 Summary of Prior Clinical Experience \n \nLiteCure conducted two studies on the safety and efficacy of NIR -TLT applied to the forehead \n(prefrontal cortex) twice a week in subjects with MDD. The device used for ELATED -2 is a \npredicate device for EXPi-laser. \n \nELATED-1 was a 3-week proof-of-concept study of TLT (EXPi - class IV laser, wavelength 808 \nnm; irradiance 700 mW / cm2; fluence 84 J / cm2; total energy 2.4 kJ per session for 6 sessions) \nAll subjects (n = 4) were treated with TLT. Mean baseline HAMD -17 sc ores for depression \ndecreased from 19.8 ± 4.4 (SD) to 13 ± 5.35 (SD) after treatment (p = 0.004) (Cassano et al. \n2015). (Cassano et al. 2015)."

Total fluidity delivered: 0 kJ \n \nSee section 4.3 - Dosing rationale \n \nThe console display does not provide information on the dose irradiance, showing only the mode \nnumber, e.g. Mode 1 and, although the laser exposure varies with the treatment mode, to maintain \nblinding, the treatment time will be the same in all modes: 429 seconds (7.15 minutes). In \naddition, the behavior of the device, the performance/output of all visible and audible indicators, \nincluding the graphical user interface, is identical in all modes, differing only with respect to \ntreatment irradiance. Since the  laser radiation emitted during the NIR mode is invisible to the \nnaked eye, the modes cannot be distinguished from each other, which keeps the operator and \nsubject blinded to the group tasks. \n \nDose administration for the present trial will follow the specifications: wavelength 830 nm; mean \nirradiance 54.8 mW / cm2; mean fluence 65.8 J / cm2 (according to the parameters used in the \nELATED-2 study in MGH with the Omnilux New U device), which demon strated in terms of \nimprovement of depressive symptomatology evaluated with HAMD17 in patients with major \ndepression. Therefore, by virtue of the ELATED2 findings, doses were considered for this \nintervention in patients with MDD. \n \n \n3.3 Overview of Positron Emission Tomography (PET scan)  \n \nThe main metabolite used by the brain to obtain ATP in mitochondrial oxidative processes is \nglucose, although this organ constitutes 2% of the body weight, it is known to use 20 -25% of \nthe total circulating glucose. We consider  that, therefore, it becomes the ideal vehicle to \ndetermine metabolic rates in the different regions of the brain. \n \nPositron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine study that provides maps indicating \nmetabolic activity, especially glucose metabolism in different tissues and lesions (Ropper et al. \n2008), using a radiopharmaceutical that is the union of a drug or physiological substance with \nknown pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with a positron-emitting radioactive atom. On \nthe one hand, the drug has a known biodistribution and, on the other hand, the positron-emitting \natom indicates the location of this drug after tracking in a PET camera. Because the PET system \nlacks an anatomical reference to determine the exact location of these abnormalities, PET is \ncurrently fused to a computed tomography (CT) system (Roldán-Valadez et al. 2008). The most \nfrequently use d radiopharmaceutical is fluorodeoxyglucose, which is 18F -labeled glucose, \nknown by the acronym 18FDG. \n \nThe use of positron emission tomography/computed tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose"

(Chung et. al. 2012; \nYu et. al.1997; Oron et al. 2007, Mochizuki et al. 2002) t-PBM penetrates deep into the cerebral \ncortex, modulates cortical excitability, and improves cerebral per fusion and oxygenation. The \nsafety of t-PBM has been studied in a sample of 1410 acute stroke patients, with no significant \ndifference in adverse event rates between t -PBM and sham exposure. (Hackee tal.2014; Lamp \net al.2007, Zivin et al.2009) Uncontrolled studies suggest an antidepressant effect of t -PBM in \nsubjects suffering from MDD (Cassano 2015-2017; Caldieraro et al.2018). \n \nDifferent devices have been used in the study of the effects of near infrared radiation (NIR) \ntreatment in humans. We decided to use a Litecure device specifically adapted for this study to \nallow NIR-TLT testing of different doses in a controlled manner. \n \n4.3 Dosing Rationale \n \nThe laser dose to be used in the present clinical trial is derived from previous clinical experience \nwith the use of other versions of the medical device in studies conducted in patients with acute \nstroke, major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease in whom lasers have been \nadministered with this device, which has provided guidance on saf e and potentially effective \ndoses in the study population. A summary of this information is presented in Table 1. \n \nLaser devices have a potential risk of retinal injury when used incorrectly; this is mitigated by \nthe use of protective eye equipment \"goggles\" and proper procedures to ensure eye safety \n(Barkana & Belkin, 2000). \n \nNo serious adverse events were found in our literature review (Caldieraro & Cassano, 2019). \nTwo open-label studies using 1 and 6 sessions of t -PBM reported no treatment emergent side \neffects (Cassano et al., 2015; Schiffer et al., 2009). \n \nThe safety of a t -PBM session was evaluated in three large RCTs with a combined sample of \n1410 stroke subjects (Hacke et al., 2014; Huisa et al., 2013; Lampl et al., 2007). No significant \ndifferences in the rate of adverse effects were observed between the  group receiving NIR laser \n(808 nm; 5W, 700 mW / cm2) or sham. \n \nA clinical trial with 16 sessions of t -PBM reported a higher number of mild side effects in the \nactive treatment group, the most frequent being insomnia, \"seeing bright colors,\" \"an ashtray \ntaste,\" and irritable mood (Cassano et al., 2018, p. 2). Other pot ential risks are related to \nimproper administration and will be mitigated by safety procedures, such as the use of protective \neyewear. \n \nThe risk of thermal injury from PBM administered with the parameters used in the studies we \nreviewed is considered minimal and limited to the skin. In ten people treated by TBI with 10-15 \nW lasers, a much higher power than that used in t-PBM, skin temperature increased to no more \nthan 30°C with rapid cooling after removal of the NIR light. Clinically, patients reported slight \nskin heating, but no discomfort (Morries et al., 2015)."

Laser light therapy is tested in a strict parallel design. \n \nThis study will include 112 subjects randomly assigned to each of the four NIR-TLT treatment \ngroups (28 subjects/group). \n \nAll subjects will receive three NIR -TLT treatments per week for 6 weeks and will complete a \nfollow-up evaluation two weeks after treatment completion. All subjects and investigators \n(except the study statistician) will be blinded to treatment sequence assignment. \n \nEnergy will be administered at a wavelength of 808 nm, bilaterally to two frontal areas on the \nleft and right side of the forehead, at or near electroencephalography sites F3 and F4. To \nmaintain blinding, the treatment duration will be 429 seconds (7.15 minutes) for all groups. The \ntreatment exposure (time during which the laser is active for the duration of the treatment) will \nbe specific for each group, controlled by the device to normalize the treatment fluence of each \nactive session per treatment locati on. Treatment will follow these specifications: wavelength \n830 nm; average irradiance 350 mW / cm2; average fluence of 65.8 J / cm2 (according to the \nparameters used in the ELATED -2 study at MGH with the Omnilux New U device) being the \ntotal fluence delivered: 3.6 kJ (bilateral) or 1.8 kJ (unilateral), either on the subject's forehead, \nat or near electroencephalography (EEG) sites F3 and F4. \n \nThe entire session (which includes the 429-second treatment and all procedures described in the \n\"Study Visits\" section) is estimated to take 30 minutes or less (Schiffer et al., 2009) (Lampl et \nal., 2007, Zivin et al., 2009). Additional time is needed to p repare the subject, fit the necessary \nprotections (e.g., goggles), inspect the subject's skin, set up the NIR-TLT devices, and give the \nsubject time to rest after irradiation. NIR -TLT treatment will only be administered by trained \npersonnel who are on stud y staff. All personnel administering the treatment must pass laser \nsafety training created by the American Institute for Medical Laser Applications and approved \nby the relevant Committees. The duration of irradiation will be decreased if clinically indicated, \nbased on tolerability as needed. \n \n \n4.4.1 Randomization procedure \n \nAt screening, participants will be assigned an identification number on a first-come, first-served \nbasis. When it is confirmed that the participant is eligible for the clinical trial, he/she will be \nrandomized. \n \nThe assignment of each participant to a particular treatment arm (experimental and control group \nwill be performed in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) will be done by using an electronic system, which is \ncentrally administered."

The goal of \nthe HAM-D is to quantify the degree of depression in patients who already have a diagnosis \nof major depression. Questions focus on neurovegetative and other depressive symptoms \nexperienced in the past 7 days. There are several different versions of the HAM-D; they \ndiffer only in the number of questions included. The standard form gener ally used in \nresearch studies is the 17 -item Hamilton D (HAM-D-17). Responses to the questions are \nscored on a scale of 0-4 or 0-2, with higher scores indicating more severe pathology. Scores \non the HAM -D-17 generally fall into the following ranges: a) not  depressed = 0 -7; b) \nmildly depressed = 8-13; c) moderately depressed. \n= 14-18; d) severely depressed = 19-22; e) very severely depressed = 23 or more. Validated \nin Spanish by Ramos-Brieva (1986). \n• Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology: Clinician -Rated Scale (QIDS-C) - \nThis is a brief (16 -item) clinician-rated inventory of core depressive symptoms such as \nsleep, depressed mood, appetite, concentration, suicidal ideation, interest, energy, \npsychomotor retardation, or agitation. Validated in Spanish by Planas et al. (2014). \n• Clinical Global Impressions: Severity and Improvement (CGI -S, CGI -I) - The \nclinician scores these two instruments from 1 to 7 based on the assessment of the subject's \noverall clinical status. Measured based on history and scores on other instruments: (a) \ndepressive severity (CGI-S) and (b) clinical improvement (CGI -I). Validated in Spanish \nby García-Portilla (2011). \n• Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (ASQ) - This is a 17 -item self-report questionnaire, \nused in Spanish, that measures the frequency and intensity of 17 anxiety symptoms, \nincluding nervousness, worry, irritability, trouble relaxing, insomnia, lack of energy, \ndifficulty concentrating, somatic symptoms, and impaired functioning due to anxiety. \n• Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ) - This is a comprehensive measure of \ndepression that includes assessment of symptoms on the anxiety -depression spectrum. It \nassesses irritability, anger outbursts, and anxiety symptoms along with symptoms \ncommonly considered to be symptoms of depression. Factor structure analysis of the SDQ \nidentified 5 subscales, including one on the anxiety -depression spectrum, with adequate \ninternal consistency and concurrent validity in Spanish (Pedrelli et al., 2014). \n• Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) For suicidal ideation and behavior: \nan FDA -endorsed instrument for clinical trials. This instrument systematically tracks \nsuicidal ideation and behavior (e.g., suicide attempts, desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan \nand intent) (Posner et al. 2007) Validated in Spanish by Al-Halabí et al.(2016). \n• Adverse Event Form - The adverse event form captures any adverse events (serious or \notherwise) specifically related to the application of TLT. This form will help determine if \nthe side effects of TLT are too great for a participant to continue in the study. \n• Concomitant Medication Form - This form will be completed at each TLT study visit, \nincluding the screening visit, as a safety monitoring tool."

To ensure confidentiality, data \nwill be identified in the database only by subject number, visit number, and visit date. By \nrecording study data in this manner, the information can be considered \"de -identified\" and, \ntherefore, complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \n(HIPAA) Privacy Standards for Individually Identifiable Health Information (\"Privacy Rule\"). \nAny information transmitted electronically will be fully encrypted and password pro tected. \nSubjects' names will not be entered into the database; each will be identified only by an \nidentification number.

We will minimize this risk by selecting only subjects who do not exhibit \nactive suicidal ideation at screening. We will also discontinue any subject who develops active \nsuicidal ideation during the course of the study (C -SSRS) and is considered to be in imminent \ndanger; we will then coordinate appropriate levels of care and standard antidepressant treatment \n(see 4.9 Termination). Manic changes are potential adverse events and will also be closely \nmonitored during antidepressant treatment. Our strict schedule of clinical study visits will allow \nearly recognition of t reatment-emergent suicidal ideation or prodromal hypomanic signs. \nSubjects who develop mania or hypomania will be discontinued and provided with the \nappropriate level of care. \n \nAnswering detailed questionnaires may create a slight degree of inconvenience for subjects. \n \nDuration of testing for cognitive circuitry: The total testing duration takes a total of 40 minutes \nat baseline and 40 minutes at weeks 5 and 9. There is no expected risk to patients beyond the 40 \nminutes of sitting at the computer for testing and possible startle experience. Every effort will \nbe made to ensure that patients are comfortable and safe during this period, and the study can be \nstopped at any time. Beyond these problems, there is little or no risk to patients. \n \nRisk of bruising: venous puncture may cause accidental bruising when blood is drawn from the \nforearms. \n \n4.20.2 Benefits: \nStudy subjects will receive a systematic MINI assessment of their DSM comorbidity. This \ninformation will be readily available to their treating doctors if subjects so desire and agree to \ndisclose. This information can guide long-term treatment. In the short term, the subject will \nreceive close and systematic depression follow-up and formalized cognitive assessments beyond \ncurrent standards of care. Easy access to routine physical examinations is also a potential benefit. \nSubjects will have access to a diffe rent treatment modality if counseling and/or medications \nwere not sufficient or not acceptable to them. The treatment itself with transcranial laser therapy \n(TLT) can potentially alleviate depressive symptoms on a level equal to antidepressant \nmedication. \n \n \n4.20.3 Allowed and prohibited concomitant interventions: \nNo concomitant prohibited interventions have been reported during treatment with this device. \nContraindications for use: \n \n• Do not apply infrared light to abdominal or lumbosacral points in \npregnant women. \n• Do not apply infrared light to epiphyseal lines in children. \n• Do not apply infrared light in the thoracic region or on the pacemaker \nitself in patients with pacemakers. \n• Do not apply infrared light to the thyroid gland, ovaries or testicles."

Each group will receive a different \ndose of NIR -TLT. Group tasks and dosing will be blinded to doctors, patients and outcome \nassessors. Device operators will be aware of the group assignments. \n \nThe purpose of this study is to compare the antidepressant effect of four different doses of NIR- \nTLT and to correlate this effect with the effects of the individual dose on brain electrophysiology \nand mitochondrial function. \n \n5.2 Aims of the Study \nPrimary Aims: \nA. To compare the effect(s) of each of the four doses of NIR-TLT on depression \nsymptomatology: antidepressant effect. \n \nHypothesis 1: Total HAM-D 17 scores will vary in a NIR-TLT dose-dependent manner, \nwith BPW dose being more effective. \n \nWe also expect to be able to estimate the effect size of the antidepressant action as a \nfunction of the irradiance applied to the NIR-TLT skin, with the BPW dose being more \neffective. \n \nB. Compare the safety and tolerability of each dose. \nHypothesis 2: The doses of NIR-TLT tested in this study will be safe and well tolerated \nby patients with MDD, as assessed by SAFTEE-SI and serious adverse events. \n \nWe do not anticipate dose-dependent differences in reported side effects. \n \nSecondary Aims: \n \nC. To compare the effect(s) of each of the four doses of NIR-TLT on brain electrophysiology. \n \nD. To compare the effect(s) of each of the four doses of NIR-TLT on mitochondrial function."

To study the correlations (correlating) antidepressant effects, brain electrophysiology and \nmitochondrial function of each of the NIR-TLT doses. \n \n \n5.3 Sample Size \nThe sample size was determined using G Power software version 3.1, considering a calculation \nby double mean difference with common standard deviation, assuming a significance level of \n0.05 and 90% power. The parameters used were obtained from page 7 (section \"Antidepressant \neffect according to clinician-rated measurement\") of the previous ELATED-2 study (Cassano et \nal., 2018), where the mean difference of the HAM-D17 score for the experimental group was -\n10.8± 7.55 and for the control group 4.4±6.65; such data identify a double difference of 6.4 with \ncommon standard deviation of 7.091. With this information, a total sample of 112 participants \nis obtained, taking into consideration a 20% loss rate. Each group will have 28 participants. \n \nWith n=112, in 4 groups in a longitudinal design, we estimated a power of 90% to \ndifferentiate (alpha=0.05) the therapeutic effect of the dose, giving an antidepressant \neffect and an effect variance equivalent to that obtained in participants who completed  \nthe ELATED-2 study for all groups (Cassano et al., 2018b) \n \n5.4 Baseline and Demographic Characteristics of the Subjects \nThe demographic and baseline characteristics of the subjects will be summarized for each \ntreatment. Descriptive summaries will include number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, \nmedian, minimum and maximum for continuous parameters, frequencies and percentages for \ncategorical parameters. \n \nA t-test or chi -squared test, as appropriate for quantitative or categorical data, will be used to \ndetermine whether there were differences in the baseline demographic profiles of the groups. \nDifferences were considered significant at p values <0.05. \n \n \n5.5 Efficacy and Safety Analysis for the Aims \n \nIt will be carried out as follows: \n \nA. Antidepressant effect of NIR-TLT doses: \nTo compare the antidepressant effects of NIR -TLT doses, mean changes in HAM -D 17 \nscores (for evaluation of the Primary Assessment Criteria ) and QIDS -C and CGI -S (for \nevaluation of the Secondary Assessment Criteria), will be performed for each dose at 3 \ntime points (visit 1, visit 9 and visit 18) will be compared using a repeated measures \nANCOVA. A significant ANCOVA interaction in mean score changes between groups will \nbe taken as indicating that the groups have di fferent antidepressant efficacy. If significant \nANCOVA interactions are found, paired samples t-tests will be used to explore differences \nbetween scores/groups. \n \nBoth the full analysis and the analysis by intention will be performed to analyze the severity \nof depression at the endpoint.
