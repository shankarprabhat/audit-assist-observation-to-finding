    "content": "1.1 Osimertinib (AZ9291)\nOsimertinib (AZD9291) is an irreversible, mutant specific EGFR tyrosine kinase \ninhibitor. It is effective in pre-clinical tumor models and clinical trials in patients \nwith TKI sensitizing and T790M resistant tumors. It is generally well tolerated and \nits most common side effects are mild rash and diarrhea.\n1.2 Supporting Preliminary Data\nActivating mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) \nmutations are present in approximately 20% of all lung adenocarcinomas.  \nEGFR-mutant cancers are dependent on EGFR signaling for growth and survival, \nmaking inhibition of EGFR an attractive therapeutic target. EGFR tyrosine kinase \ninhibitors (TKIs) including erlotinib and afatinib are FDA approved for the \ntreatment of EGFR-mutant lung cancers based on superior responses and \nprogression free survival compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy.1,2 All patients that \nare treated with EGFR TKIs will eventually develop therapeutic resistance, on \naverage after 10-12 months of therapy.\n1,2Tumor cells from more than half of \npatients with such “acquired resistance” contain a recurrent second-site mutation \n(T790M) in the EGFR kinase domain.3,4 EGFR T790M is often described as a \ngatekeeper mutation, and this substitution results in steric hindrance that \nprevents drug binding and also changes the receptor affinity for ATP.5 At present, \nthere are no FDA approved therapies for patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer \nwho develop acquired resistance mediated by the T790M mutation. \nThe first- and second- generation EGFR TKIs (erlotinib and afatinib, respectively) \nwere designed to inhibit wild-type EGFR. Recently, a new class of pyrimidine-\nbased EGFR TKIs has been developed which irreversibly inhibits classically \nsensitizing (EGFR L858R, EGFR exon 19 deletions [ex19del]) and resistant \n(EGFR T790M) forms of EGFR. The first drug in this class was WZ4002, and \nadditional drugs include osimertinib (AZD9291), CO-1686, HM61713, EGF816 \nand ASP8273. Osimertinib (AZD9291) has a greater than 200 times selectivity \nfor EGFR L858R/T790M over wild-type EGFR (IC50s 480 nM to 1.8 μM across \ndifferent cell lines).6 Treatment with osimertinib (AZD9291) in EGFR L858R, \nEGFR ex19del,  EGFR L858R/T790M and EGFR ex19del/T790M xenograft \ntumors also led to profound tumor growth regression. Osimertinib (AZD9291) \nInvestigator’s Brochure 2014)\nThe phase 1 study of osimertinib (AZD9291) (NCT01802632) has shown \nextremely promising activity, specifically in patients with lung adenocarcinomas \nthat harbor EGFR T790M.7 A total of 127 patients with centrally confirmed EGFR \nT790M who could be evaluated for response: the response rate was 61% (95% \nCI 52-70) and median PFS was 9.6 months (95% CI, 8.3 to not reached). \nAmong all patients treated, no dose-limiting toxicities were seen at any of the \ndoses evaluated. The most common (>10%) adverse events were diarrhea, \nrash/acne, nausea, decreased appetite, dry skin, pruritis, fatigue, paronychia, \nconstipation, cough stomatitis, vomiting, anemia, dyspnea, upper respiratory tract \ninfection, headache as presented in the Janne et al 2015 paper. Please refer to \nthe Investigator’s Brochure for comprehensive safety data."

Of these, 12 were \nCTCAE Grade 1-2 events, 8 were Grade 3-4 events and 3 fatal (Grade 5) events \n(0.3%) as outlined above. Two events haven’t had a CTCAE grade reported yet.\n11 patients experienced prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval; none of \nthese 11 events resulted in reduction or discontinuation of osimertinib \n(AZD9291). There were 7 fatal adverse events; 1/7 of these events was a \npneumonia which was reported as being possibly drug-related.\nThe excellent responses of EGFR T790M harboring lung adenocarcinomas to \nosimertinib (AZD9291) provide the rationale to assess osimertinib (AZD9291) in \nother tumors with EGFR T790M. Osimertinib (AZD9291) is also active in pre-\nclinical studies against other types of EGFR mutations which suggest that the \ncompound may provide clinical benefit in tumors with other rare EGFR mutations \nas well.\nComprehensive mutation profiling allows us to identify rare, potentially actionable \nmutations in a wide array of cancer types. Figure 1 illustrates the frequency of \nEGFR mutations in various tumor types demonstrating that a broad array of \ncancers have a low frequency of these mutations of interest. EGFR T790M and \nother rare variants such as vIII, G719S, L861Q, exon 19 and 20 insertions \nrepresent a small minority of these EGFR mutations. In the COSMIC database, \nwe identified listings of EGFR T790M mutations in cancers of the upper \naerodigestive tract, the biliary tract, the large intestine, the central nervous \nsystem and the skin and we suspect these mutations will be more likely to be \ncommonly identified as comprehensive molecular testing becomes routine for all \ntumors.\nThe phase 1 study of osimertinib (AZD9291) was conducted in patients with \npredominantly EGFR L858R or EGFR ex19del and concurrent EGFR T790M; \nthere is no available clinical data to indicate whether osimertinib (AZD9291) has \nactivity against tumors with other rare EGFR mutations or with T790M alone. \nThere is preclinical data that demonstrates activity of osimertinib (AZD9291) in \ncells transfected with EGFR G719S, L861Q, exon 19 insertions, EGFR variant III,\nand HER2 exon 20 insertions.\n6 We propose studying AZD9291 in patients with \nEGFR T790M in cancers other than lung adenocarcinomas. We also propose \nassessing the activity of AZD9291 in cancers with rare EGFR mutations among \nwhich osimertinib (AZD9291) was efficacious in pre-clinical studies (providing \nMATCH Level 3 evidence – see MATCH Master Protocol).\nRev.2/16"

Electrolyte and vital sign assessments, \nincluding pulse rate and blood pressure, will be monitored regularly \nthroughout the study. ECG will be performed at enrollment and prior to each \ntreatment cycle. The investigator or designated physician will review each \nECG prior to discharge from the clinic and may refer to a local cardiologist if \nappropriate for immediate management of the patient. A paper copy should \nbe filed in the patient’s medical records.

Avoid concomitant \nuse of strong CYP3A4 inducers.  CYP3A4 inhibitors are not likely to \naffect the exposure of osimertinib (AZD9291).  Based on in vitro\nstudies, osimertinib (AZD9291) is a competitive inhibitor of CYP 3A4/5 \nbut not CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 at clinically \nrelevant concentrations. Osimertinib (AZD9291) is an inducer of \nCYP1A2.  Use caution with coadministration of CYP 3A4/5 and 1A2 \nsubstrates.\nOsimertinib (AZD9291) is a substrate of BCRP and P-gp but is \nunlikely to result in clinically relevant drug interactions.  Osimertinib \n(AZD9291) is not a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and does \nnot inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1 and \nMATE2K at clinically relevant concentrations.  Based on in vitro data, \nosimertinib (AZD9291) is an inhibitor of BCRP and may increase the \nexposure of BCRP substrates.  Osimertinib (AZD9291) does not \ninhibit P-gp at clinically relevant concentrations but has the potential \nto increase exposure of sensitive substrates.\nAvoid use of osimertinib (AZD9291) in patients with congenital long \nQT syndrome. For patients with normal QT interval at the trial \nenrollment, avoid use of concomitant drugs that are known to prolong \nQT interval and use caution with drugs that may prolong QT interval. \nRefer to a frequently updated drug information reference and to the \nprotocol for appropriate cardiac monitoring.\n5.1.9 Side Effects \nSee Section 3.3 for side effects.\n5.1.10 Patient Care Implications\nAdvise patients of reproductive potential to use effective methods of \ncontraception. Patients of child-bearing potential must use an \nappropriate double barrier method of birth control (such as female use \nof a diaphragm, intrauterine device (IUD), sponge and spermicide, in \naddition to the male use of a condom) or involve female use of \nprescribed “birth control pills” or a prescribed birth control implant. \nBoth double barrier contraception and birth control pill or implants \nmust be used for at least one week prior to the start of the study and \ncontinuing for 16 weeks after the last dose of the study drugs.\nMale patients must use barrier contraceptives (i.e., by use of \ncondoms) from the start of study and continue for 16 weeks after the \nleast dose of the study drugs.
